Manage Menus
============

AtoM includes a menu customization feature that allows authenticated (i.e.
logged-in) :term:`administrators <administrator>` to manage menu labels; menus
can be edited, created, moved menus to different positions on the page, deleted
as necessary.

In AtoM, "menus" and "menu labels" refer to

To view a list of menus, click the |gears|:ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu in
the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar` and select "Menus" from

An authenticated (i.e. logged in) user with edit privileges can edit or update
a menu type at any time. For more information on edit
privileges and user roles see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. For information
on logging in, see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

**To add a menu in AtoM:**

1. Navigate to the menu list: click on the |gears|:ref:`Admin <main-
   menu-admin>` menu in the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`
   and select "Menus" from the :term:`drop-down menu`. AtoM will direct you to
   the "Site menu list" :term:`view page`.
2. Click on the blue menu name you wish to edit to be directed to that menu's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the menu name with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` and editable :term:`fields
   <field>` grouped under them.
4. Add or edit data as required.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   menu type.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record. You will be redirected to the main page.
