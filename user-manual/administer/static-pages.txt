Manage static pages
===================

In AtoM, :term:`static pages <static page>` are pages that are designed to look
the same each time they are accessed; this is in contrast to dynamic pages,
which can vary according to your network or institution and according to the
content that is uploaded into AtoM. Examples of dynamic pages include:
:ref:`search results pages <search-results>`; :term:`view pages <view page>`;
and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

By default, AtoM has two :term:`static pages <static page>`: the
:term:`Home page` and the :term:`About page`. A default welcome message appears
on the :term:`Home page` when first logging into AtoM.

The :term:`About page` provides additional information about the application and
the project. To access the :term:`About page`, click on the |info|:ref:`Quick
links menu <quick-links-menu>` in the :term:`main menu` located in the
:term:`header bar`. and select "About".
