Manage static pages
===================

In AtoM, :term:`static pages <static page>` are pages that are designed to look
the same each time they are accessed; this is in contrast to dynamic pages,
which can vary according to your network or institution and according to the
content that is uploaded into AtoM. Examples of dynamic pages include:
search results pages; :term:`view pages <view page>`;
and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. By default, AtoM has two :term:`static pages
<static page>`: the :term:`Home page` and the :term:`About page`.

A default welcome message appears on the :term:`Home page` when first logging
into AtoM.

.. image:: images/welcome-page.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of the Home page

The :term:`About page` provides additional information about the application and
the project. To access the :term:`About page`, click on the |info| :ref:`Quick
links menu <quick-links-menu>` in the :term:`main menu` located in the
:term:`header bar` and select "About".

In AtoM, :term:`static pages <static page>`, that is both the :term:`Home page`
and the :term:`About page` can be edited by authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`aministrators <administrator>` or :term:`editors <editor>` to reflect
your own institution's or network's requirements.

This section contains instructions on how to edit :term:`static
pages <static page>` in AtoM. There are two ways to edit :term:`static pages
<static page>` - doing so via the |info| :ref:`Quick links menu
<quick-links-menu>` in the :term:`main menu` and selecting either "Home" or
"About" from the :term:`drop-down menu` is the easiest, but to accommodate
different workflows, these :term:`static pages <static page>` can also
be edited by clicking the the |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` and
selecting "Static pages" from the :term:`drop-down menu`. This second option
will route you to a "List" page, where all :term:`static pages <static page>`
in the application will be listed. Navigate to the :term:`static page` you wish
to edit by clicking on the blue menu name. Below are instructions to edit to
the :ref:`Home page <edit-home-page>` and the :ref:`About page
<edit-about-page>`.

  :term:`drop-down menu`; **or**
* Clicking the |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` of the
  :term:`header bar` and selecting "Static pages" from the
  :term:`drop-down menu`. Once you are directed to the "List page" for
  :term:`static pages <static page>`, click on the "Welcome" blue menu.

All three options will direct you to the :term:`Home page` :term:`view page`.

.. NOTE::

   Editing the "Title" :term:`field` of the :term:`Home page` will edit the
   blue menu that you will select in the :term:`static page` "List page" (i.e.
   if you change "Welcome" to say "Bienvenue", the blue menu in the "List
   page", as well as the main header of the :term:`Home page` will change to
   "Bienvenue").

2. To switch from the main :term:`view page` to :term:`edit mode`, click on the
   :term:`edit button` in the :term:`button block`.
3. On loading, the `edit page` will display a "Title" :term:`field`, a
   :term:`Slug` :term:`field` and a "Content" :term:`field`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The :term:`Slug` :term:`field` is a hard-coded page title referenced by AtoM
   code to manage URLs; it **cannot be changed** for the :term:`Home page` or
   the :term:`About page`. However, it can be edited in any static pages that
   you :ref:`add yourself <add-static-page>`.

   pages <static page>`.

5. You can quit the edit process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved. Note

.. _add-static-page:

Add a new static page
=====================

In AtoM, new :term:`static pages <static page>` can be added at any time by any
authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator`. Similar to both the
:term:`Home page` and the :term:`About page`, you may wish to add a new static
page in order to include permanent, or "timeless" content to your webpage.
:term:`Static pages <static page>` may be customized to offers users
instructions or help in navigating the site (i.e. a "Help" page),
provide contact information (i.e. a "Contact Us" page), or feature website
content, categories, and/or contributors.

To add a new static page in AtoM:

1. Click the the |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` in the
   :term:`header bar` and select "Static pages" from the :term:`drop-down menu`.
2. You will be directed to a "List pages" page, where all :term:`static pages
   <static page>`, including the :term:`Home page` and the :term:`About page`
   will be listed.
3. Click on the :term:`Add new button` in the :term:`button block` to be
   directed to the :term:`edit page` for your new static page.
4. On loading, the `edit page` will display blank "Title", :term:`Slug` and
   "Content" :term:`fields <field>`. Add data as required.

.. TIP::

   The :term:`slug` indicates the word, or sequence of words that will be
   visible to users in the URL link when they are navigating on a specific
   :term:`static page` (e.g.: the slug in the URL *www.artefactual.com/help* is
   */help*). The slug should be indicative of the content of that specific
   static page.

   When creating a new :term:`static page`, the :term:`slug` :term:`field` can
   either be customized or left blank. If you choose to customize the
   :term:`slug`, make the slug all lowercase, keep it short, and avoid accented
   characters (e.g.: "é"; "ñ"; "û") and punctuation (e.g.: "!"; ";"; "..."). If
   you leave the :term:`field` blank, AtoM will automatically generate a slug
   based on the "Title" you have indicated for your page (e.g.: If your "Title"
   is *About Us*, the slug for that static page will automatically be generated
   as *.../about-us*). Note that AtoM will automatically replace all accented
   characters with letters from the English alphabet and punctuation will either
   be removed or replaced by a dash "-" or percent-encoding (e.g.: If your
   "Title" is *Instructions & More*, the slug for that static page will
   automatically be generated as *.../instructions%26more* or
   *.../instructions-more*, unless otherwise indicated). The :term:`slug` will
   also appear in the once blank "Slug" :term:`field` and can be viewed when
   switching from the :term:`view page` to the :term:`edit page` of that
   :term:`static page`.

.. WARNING::

   A :term:`slug` cannot be duplicated once it has been generated in AtoM.
   If you duplicate a slug, AtoM will automatically generate a "-2 (or the next
   subsequent number) at the end of the slug to distinguish it from the other
   one in the same name (e.g.: Two slugs titled *information* will result in the
   second of the two becoming *information-2*). If you remove an AtoM
   automatically generated :term:`slug` from the slug :term:`field` of a
   :term:`static page` you've created, AtoM will not re-generate the original
   slug, regardless of whether or not the "Title" of your page has changed;
   rather, it will generate a new slug in the form of a series of letters and
   numbers. **This should be avoided**, as it creates confusion because it does
   not accurately indicate the content of that :term:`static page`. To avoid
   this, simply enter a custom :term:`slug`.

5. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no new :term:`static page` being
   created.
6. When you are finished creating your new :term:`static page`, click the "Save"
   button in the :term:`button block`.

You will be directed to the :term:`view page` of the new :term:`static page`
where you can view your changes. The page can be :ref:`edited
<edit-static-page>` again at any time.

.. _add-links-static:

Add links to a new static page
==============================

Once a new :term:`static page` has been created, a new link must also be
created in order to allow users to navigate to the new static page. You can do
this by either creating a link within one of the default :term:`static pages
<static page>` or by clicking Admin > Menus and clicking the
:term:`Add new button` in the :term:`button block` or by linking the new
:term:`static page` to an existing menu.

This example shows a newly created "Contact Us" :term:`static page` that has
been added as a menu under the |info| :ref:`Quick links <quick-links-menu>`
parent menu:

.. image:: images/add-new-menu.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of Contact Us menu linked under Quick Links menu

Here is the result of the above:

.. image:: images/new-contact-us.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of new Contact Us menu

For more information on managing menus in AtoM, see: :ref:`manage-menus`.

.. _styling-static-page:

Styling static pages
====================

Basic styling of :term:`static pages <static page>` can be achieved by including
`HTML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html>`__ and inline
`CSS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS>`__ code
to the "Content" :term:`field`. There are plenty of wonderful online tutorials
and resources out there for instruction on HTML and inline CSS use, but a few
basic examples commonly employed by AtoM users have been included here as an
example.
