Every user who wishes to add, edit, or delete content within the database must
have a registered :term:`user account`. Only an authenticated (i.e. logged in)
:term:`administrator` can add a new user account.

1. In the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`, click the |gears|
   :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu and select "Users" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`. This will take you to a list of current user
   accounts.

.. NOTE::

   The "List users" page has two presentation options: "Show active only" and
   "Show inactive only" which allow the Administrator to view active users and
   inactive users in the system.

2. Scroll to the botom of the "List users" page and click the "Add new" button
   in the :term:`button block`. AtoM will direct you to a blank User :term:`edit
   page`.
3. In the "Basic info" :term:`information area`, enter the following data:

* In :term:`"Username" <Username>`, enter the user's name;
* In "Email", enter the user's email address. The email address (rather than
  the username) is used when logging in. For more information on logging in,
  see: :ref:`log in <log-in>`;
* In :term:`"Password" <Password>`, enter the user's default password. Users
  can later change their own password. For more information, see:
  :ref:`change-password`.
* In "Confirm password" enter the :term:`password` again.

4. In the "Access control" information area, type the appropriate "User groups".
   You must choose between 4 options:

* :term:`Administrator`
* :term:`Editor`
* :term:`Contributor`
* :term:`Translator`

 As you type, matching results will load in a :term:`drop-down menu` below the
 field.

.. NOTE::

   The user group, or :term:`user role` determines the user's :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>`. This will control the way the user can
   interact with AtoM. The user role of a specific user can be changed at any
   time by an auhenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator`. For more
   information on user roles, see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

.. TIP::

   Multiple :term:`user roles <user role>` can be added to one user. A user may
   need to have both :term:`editor` and :term:`translator` :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>`. Once one user role has been selected, it will
   appear in bullet form under "User groups" and a second group can then be
   added. To remove a selected user group, simply hover over the user group you
   would like to select; click on the "**X**" that will appear next the group
   name.

5. Under the "Allowed languages for translation" section, select one of three
   options:

* English
* French
* Spanish

 As you type, matching results will load in a :term:`drop-down menu` below the
 field.

6. You can quit the process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button, or
   the exiting (i.e. clicking "**X**") the window. Any changes made will not
   be saved.
7. When you have complete, click the "Create" button. You will be redirected
   to a :term:`view page` where the new :term:`user profile` will be
   displayed. The user profile will also display the following permission
   :term:`information areas <information area>`: Information object
   permissions", "Actor permissions", "Taxonomy permissions", and "Archival
   institution permissions". For more information on user permissions, see
   :ref:`Edit user permissions <edit-user-permissions>`.

.. Note::

   By default, the user will be automatically *Active* once the new user
   account is created. You must un-check the box next to "Active" in order to
   make a user inactive.

For more on user roles, see :ref:`user roles <user-roles>`.
