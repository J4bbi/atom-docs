Global settings allow :term:`administrators <administrator>` to control certain
aspects of how AtoM appears and behaves.

To access the "Settings" menu in AtoM, click on the |gears| :ref:`Admin
menu <main-menu-admin>` in the :term:`main menu` located in the
:term:`header bar` and select "Settings" from the :term:`drop-down menu`. You
will be redirected to the "Site Settings", where a number of :term:`information
areas <information area>`, including the "Global" settings, should be opened.
If closed, simply click on the "Global" blue menu to open the area and view the
:term:`fields <field>`.

This section will describe each :term:`field` in the "Global"
:term:`information area`:

* :ref:`Application version <application-version>`
* :ref:`Check for updates <check-updates>`
* :ref:`Maximum image width <max-image-width>`
* :ref:`Results per page <results-page>`
* :ref:`Accession mask <accession-mask>`
* :ref:`Accession counter <accession-counter>`
* :ref:`Reference code separator <reference-code-separator>`

* :ref:`Sort treeview (information object) <sort-treeview>`
* :ref:`Sort browser (users) <sort-browser-users>`
* :ref:`Sort browser (anonymous) <sort-browser-anonymous>`
* :ref:`Multiple repositories <multiple-repositories>`
* :ref:`Default archival institution upload limit <default-institution-upload>`

* :ref:`Upload multi-page files as multiple descriptions <upload-multi-files>`
* :ref:`Show tooltips <tooltips>`
* :ref:`Default publication status <default-publication-status>`
* :ref:`SWORD deposit directory <sword-directory>`

Hovering over each :term:`field` will also provide additional information on
that field - it will appear in a white "information box" below your cursor.

When making changes to the global settings in AtoM, don't forget to click the
"Save" button in the :term:`button block`, located at the bottom of the "Global"
settings :term:`information area`.

.. _application-version:

Application version
-------------------

This :term:`field` shows the current version of the software. The value is pre-
set, ships with the application, and cannot be edited. The version number is
automatically updated when AtoM is upgraded to a newer release.

For more information on installing AtoM and searching for different versions,
see:

* Installing AtoM with:

  * :ref:`Linus <installation-linux>`
  * :ref:`Windows <installation-windows>`
  * :ref:`Mac OS X <installation-macosx>`

* :ref:`Search for updates <search-updates>`

.. _check-updates:

Check for updates
-----------------

If yes is selected, an :term:`administrator` will automatically receive a
notification if a newer version of the AtoM software has been released and can
be installed.

For more information on updates, see:

* :ref:`Search for updates <search-updates>`

.. _max-image-width:

Maximum image width (pixels)
----------------------------

One of AtoM's design assumptions is that the display dimensions of files
users upload typically will be too large to fit into the :term:`view page` for
an :term:`archival description`. Therefore, when you upload a file, AtoM creates
a :term:`reference display copy` for displaying in the view page.

AtoM ships with a default setting specifying the maximum width of the
:term:`reference display copy` at **480 pixels**. This is the optimized width
given AtoM's :term:`field` width. :term:`Administrators <administrator>`,
however, can increase or decrease the maximum reference image
width to suit the requirements of their institution or network.

   * :ref:`Styling static pages <styling-static-page>`
   * :ref:`Themes & Theming <themes-theming>`

.. _results-page:

Results per page
----------------

By default, AtoM lists objects in list pages and search results **ten at a
time**, with a pager at the bottom of the page to allow users to navigate
through long lists of objects. :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can
increase or decrease this default number.

For more information on navigating in AtoM, see :ref:`Searching in AtoM
<search-atom>` and :ref:`Navigating in AtoM <navigate>`.

.. _accession-mask:

Accession mask
--------------

By default, AtoM creates the :term:`accession record` identifier as a unique
number compiled from [YEAR MONTH DAY Incremental#].

For more information on accession records, see :ref:`accession-records`.

.. _accession-counter:

Accession counter
-----------------

AtoM provides you with the number of :term:`accessions <accession record>`
created. If you delete an accession, it will still be included in the Accession
counter total value.

.. _reference-code-separator:

Reference code separator
------------------------

The reference code separator is the character seperating hierarchal elements in
a reference code. By default, the reference code separator appears as a dash "-"
in AtoM.

.. _inherit-reference-code:

Inherit reference code (information object)
-------------------------------------------

When this is set to "yes", the reference code string will be built using the
archival description identifier plus the identifier of all its ancestors
(:term:`parent records <parent record>`). For more information about how the
reference code works, see :ref:`search-archival-descriptions`.

.. _sort-treeview:

Sort treeview (information object)
----------------------------------

This setting determines how lower-level :term:`descriptions <archival
description>` are sorted in an :term:`archival description's <archival
description>` :term:`context menu`.

Selecting "manual" means the descriptions will appear in the order in which they
were entered into AtoM.
Selecting "title" sorts the descriptions by title.
Selecting "identifier - title" sorts the descriptions by identifier, then by
title.

For more information, see :ref:`treeview-search`.

.. _sort-browser-users:

Sort browser (users)
--------------------

:term:`Administrators <administrator>` can configure default sort order for the
browse display as either "alphabetic" or "last updated" for logged-in users.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Browsing in AtoM <browse>`
   * :ref:`user-roles`

.. _sort-browser-anonymous:

Sort browser (anonymous)
------------------------

:term:`Administrators <administrator>` can configure default sort order for the
browse display as either, "alphabetic" or "last updated" for public users
(e.g., not logged-in).

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Browsing in AtoM <browse>`
   * :ref:`user-roles`

.. _multiple-repositories:

Multiple repositories
---------------------

Select "yes" if your AtoM application is acting as a union list or portal for
:term:`descriptions <archival description>` of materials held at more than one
:term:`archival institution` or :term:`repository`. The repository will appear
as a column on the "Browse archival descriptions" page. The repository will
appear as a link in the :term:`context menu`.

Select "no" if your AtoM application is being used only by a single institution.
By selecting "no", the repository name will be excluded from certain displays
because it will be too repetitive and the :term:`creator` rather than the
repository will now appear as a column on the list :term:`archival description`
page.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`Browsing in AtoM <browse>`
   * :ref:`archival-descriptions`
   * :ref:`archival-institutions`

.. _default-institution-upload:

Default archival institution upload limit (GB)
----------------------------------------------

"1" is the value for unlimited upload. This setting can be modified by an
authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator`.

A value of "0" (zero) disables file upload. A value of "-1" allows unlimited
uploads.

For more information, see :ref:`upload-digital-objects`.

.. _total-upload-space:

Total space available for uploads
---------------------------------

contentcontentcontent

.. _upload-multi-files:

Upload multi-page files as multiple descriptions
------------------------------------------------

Select "yes" if you would like each page of a multi-page file to be attached to
a separate child-level description. For example, a PDF file with 10 pages
uploaded to a description would result in 10 individual descriptions, one for
each page in the file.

Select, "no" if you would like one multi-page file to be attached to a single
description.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`archival-descriptions`

.. _tooltips:

Show tooltips
-------------

:term:`Tooltips` are online text designed to assist users to enter data in
:term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

:term:`Administrators <administrator>` can select "yes" to to have tooltips
appear in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` as the user enters data. Selecting "no"
will disable tooltips.

.. _default-publication-status:

Default publication status
--------------------------

This setting determines whether new :term:`archival descriptions <archival
description>` will automatically appear as :term:`draft records <draft record>`
or :term:`published records <published record>`. Note that this setting also
affects imported descriptions. For more information, see
:ref:`archival-descriptions`.

.. _sword-directory:

SWORD deposit directory
-----------------------

In 1.3 release, the SWORD deposit directory is being used to support packages
deposited by Archivematica into AtoM. (In future releases we will use this
protocol to interact with other systems.) Developers interested learning more
about Sword can visit : [insert link].
