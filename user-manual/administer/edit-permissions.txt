=====================
Edit user permissions
=====================

* :ref:`Default user group permissions settings in AtoM
  <default-group-permissions>`
* :ref:`Setting permissions by archival description
  <archival-description-permissions>`
* :ref:`Setting permissions by authority record <authority-record-permissions>`
* :ref:`Setting permissions by term and taxonomy <taxonomy-permissions>`
* :ref:`Setting permissions by archival institution <institution-permissions>`

Each permission setting can be edited either by *user** or by **group**; each
section mentioned above can thus be navigated according to "Edit permissions by
user" or "Edit permissions by user group".


.. IMPORTANT:

Only an authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can modify a
user's :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` After the desired changes
have been made to a user's access permission settings, the administrator can log
out and log back in as the user  in order to verify the results of the
modifications.


.. _default-group-permissions:

Default user group permissions settings in AtoM
===============================================

In AtoM, user :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` are divided by 4
permissions :term:`information areas <information area>`:

* :ref:`Archival description permissions <archival-description-permissions>`
* :ref:`Authority record permissions <authority-record-permissions>`
* :ref:`Taxonomy permissions <taxonomy-permissions>`
* :ref:`Archival institution permissions <institution-permissions>`

Each permission :term:`information area` contains individual permission
settings. By clicking on the specific permissions information area, AtoM will
direct you to the :term:`view page` of that permission, where the permission
settings for that specific user group will be displayed. Permissions can be
edited by switching from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode`; simply click
the :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   An authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` must be in
   :term:`edit mode` in order to be able to view *all* actions permissions that
   are available for a specific permission. In :term:`view mode`, only those
   actions which are not indicated as "Inherit", or in default, will be
   displayed.

On loading, AtoM will display the "Action" and the "Permission"
setting for that specific permissions :term:`information area`. In AtoM, an
"Action" represents different types of permissions, or :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>` that can be given to a user. "Actions" will vary according
to the permission type (i.e. the permission :term:`information area`) that you
are viewing. Each permissions type will contain a list of default actions

Every "Action" includes the option to select one of the following three
permission settings:

* Grant |grant|
* Deny |deny|
* Inherit |inherit|

.. |grant| image:: images/grant.png
   :height: 23

.. |dash| image:: images/dash.png
   :height: 23
   :width: 20

Default permission settings will be displayed in 2 ways in AtoM: when viewing
permission settings in :term:`edit mode`, "Inherit" |inherit-select| will
automatically be selected when the default setting has been chosen by an
:term:`administrator` for a specific action; when viewing permission settings in
:term:`view mode`, AtoM will simply display a dash |dash| in place of "Inherit"
when the default setting has been chosen by an :term:`administrator` for a
specific action.
