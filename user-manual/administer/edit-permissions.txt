Edit permissions
================

User permissions define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
view-only access to full administration rights. These :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>`, or permissions, can be navigated by :ref:`user-roles`,
which are defined by "Groups" that an authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can add and edit (see :ref:`manage-user-accounts`). When a
specific user is assigned to a "Group", he/she automatically inherits the
access privileges of that user group. However, administrators can also edit the
access privileges of a specific user if they wish. Each access privilege can
be edited either by **User** or by **Group**; the sections below have been
drafted in a way that reflects these options.

**Below you'll find instructions on how to:**

.. _default-access-privileges:

Default access privileges
-------------------------

An authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can view and edit access privileges of either a group or a
user by navigating between 4 different :term:`permissions tabs <permissions
tab>`:

* :ref:`Archival description permissions <description-permissions>`
* :ref:`Authority record permissions <authority-record-permissions>`
* :ref:`Taxonomy permissions <taxonomy-permissions>`
* :ref:`Archival institution permissions <institution-permissions>`

Each :term:`permissions tab` contains individual :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>` located under a header labeled as "Action". Clicking on a
specific permissions tab will direct you to the :term:`view page` of that
permission, where the access privileges for that specific user role will be
displayed under a heading labeled "Permissions". An authenticated (i.e. logged-
in) :term:`administrator` can edit access privileges by switching from
:term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode`; simply click the
:term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block`.

.. NOTE::

   An authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` must be in
   :term:`edit mode` in order to be able to view and edit *all* :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>` that are available for a specific
   :term:`permissions tab` In :term:`view mode`, only those actions which
   are not indicated as "Inherit", or in default, will be displayed.

Access privileges, or "Actions" will vary according to the permission type (i.e.
the :term:`permissions tab`) that has been selected. Because each permission
type has a different list of default "Actions", this section lists permission-
specific instructions have been included below.

   :alt: An image of default actions in Archival description permissions

The "Archival description permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will
display the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be
maintained for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. Specific
privileges can be set with regards to reading, creating, updating, deleting,
viewing drafts, publishing, acccessing master copies and/or accessing reference
copies of either *all* archival descriptions, specific archival descriptions, or
*all* archival descriptions of a specific institution.

.. NOTE::

   In order to fully test the option of setting specific :term:`access
   privileges <access privilege>` for *all* :term:`archival descriptions
   <archival description>` linked to a specific :term:`archival institution`,
   you should have two or more archival institutions in your system, with
   several hierarchical descriptions attached and some digital objects uploaded.

A authenticated (i.e.logged-in) :term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny**
a user's access privileges to a specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on
the default permissions as they are established by AtoM by selecting a default
user "Group". For more information on default access settings, see:
:ref:`below <default-permissions-by-role>`.

.. _authority-default-actions:

   :alt: An image of default actions in Authority record permissions

The "Authority record permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will display
the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be maintained
for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` :term:`authority records <authority record>`. Specific privileges
can be set with regards to reading, creating, updating, and deleting either
*all* authority records or specific authority records
belonging to an archival institution. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny** a user's access privileges to a
specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on the default permissions as
they are established by AtoM by selecting a default user "Group". For more
information on default access settings, see: :ref:`below
<default-permissions-by-role>`.

   :alt: An image of default actions in Taxonomy permissions

The "Taxonomy permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will display the
specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be maintained for
users interacting with :term:`terms <term>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.
Specific privileges can be set with regards to creating, updating, and deleting
either *all* terms, or specific taxonomies. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrator` can **Grant** or **Deny** a user's access privileges to
a specific *Action*, or administrators can rely on the default permissions as
they are established by AtoM by selecting a default user "Group". For more
information on default access settings, see: :ref:`below

   In order to fully test the scenarios in this section, you should have two or
   more archival institutions in your system, with several hierarchical
   descriptions attached and some digital objects uploaded.

The "Archival institution permissions" :term:`tab <permissions tab>` will
display the specific :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` that can be
maintained for users interacting with an :term:`archival institution's <archival
institution>` settings. Specific privileges can be set with regards to reading,
creating, updating, and deleting the settings for either *all* the archival
institutions linked to one system, or a specific archival institution linked to
one system. A authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can **Grant**
or **Deny** a user's access privileges to a specific *Action*, or administrators
can rely on the default permissions as they are established by AtoM by selecting
a default user "Group". For more information on default access settings, see:
:ref:`below <default-permissions-by-role>`.


.. _default-permissions-by-role:

Default permissions by user role
--------------------------------

When creating a new user in AtoM, the user account can be tied to one of 5
default "User groups":

* :term:`Researcher`
* :term:`Administrator`
* :term:`Editor`
* :term:`Contributor`
* :term:`Translator`

Each user group contains default :term:`access privileges <access privilege>`,
or "Actions" that define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
view-only access to full administration rights. Each "Action" includes the
option to select one of the following three :term:`access privileges <access
privilege>, or "Permission", displayed as radio buttons:

* Grant |grant|
* Deny |deny|
* Inherit |inherit|

.. |grant| image:: images/grant.png

Access privileges, or "Actions" will vary according to the permission type
(i.e. the :term:`permissions tab`) that has been selected. Because each
permission type has a different list of default "Permissions",
this section lists permission-specific instructions have been included below.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default settings: Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default settings: Contributor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default settings: Translator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. NOTE::

   Default permission settings will be displayed in 2 ways in AtoM: when viewing
   permission settings in :term:`edit mode`, "Inherit" |inherit-select| will
   automatically be selected when the default setting has been chosen by an
   :term:`administrator` for a specific action; when viewing permission settings
   in :term:`view mode`, AtoM will simply display a dash |dash| in place of
   "Inherit" when the default setting has been chosen by an
   :term:`administrator` for a specific action.

Setting permissions by archival description
===========================================


.. IMPORTANT:

Only an authenticated (i.e. logged-in) :term:`administrator` can modify a user's
:term:`access privileges <access privilege>`. After the desired changes have
been made to a user's access privileges, or "Permissions", the
administrator can log out and log back in as that specific user in order to
