Site logo
=========

In AtoM, the site logo is the graphic that appears at the top of all pages in
the left-hand corner of the :term:`header bar`. Clicking on
the logo will take the user to the :term:`home page`. AtoM ships with
a default logo that can only be replaced by authenticated (i.e. logged-in)
:term:`administrators <administrator>` to theme the application to
their own institution or :term:`network` if desired.

.. TIP::

   Users who do **not** wish to have a logo can remove it by clicking on the
   |gears| :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menu in the :term:`main menu` located
   in the :term:`header bar` and selecting "Settings" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`. Scroll down to the "Default page elements" and
   unselect the "Logo" value. This will remove the AtoM logo (or your own logo)
   from the AtoM header bar. For more information, see :ref:`Settings`.
