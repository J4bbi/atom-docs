AtoM offers users the ability to print lists of files and items. Both public
users and logged-in users have access to printing lists of files and items.
The printer icon |print| is presented alongside the hyperlink Reports in the top,
right-hand corner of the :term:`Archival description` view page.


.. TIP::

   Before you click on Reports, make sure that the
   :term:`archival description`  you are viewing has
   :term:`child records <Child record>`that correspond to files and items. If
   the the archival description does not have any information at the file-level,
   you will not be successful at printing a file list.
