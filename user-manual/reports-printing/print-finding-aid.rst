   As of AtoM version 2.0, the ability to create and print

   functionality in future versions.

Print finding aid
=================

Navigate to the View :term:`archival description` screen and select the
:term:`level of description` (e.g., fonds, series, file etc.) that you want to
view. For general purposes the highest level will provide you with an overview
of the materials in context and consolidate information about the :term:`fonds`
including extent and medium, scope and content, admin/biographical history and
rights.

option to print "as is", see a preview of the print and save it as a pdf.
