Translate Content
-----------------

To translate the content of an archival description, authority record,
archival insitution, or term, a user with translation privileges will open
the translate user interface dialog and work within it.

1. Log in with an account that has translation privileges.
2. Start in your default language (e.g., English). Navigate to the content
   you want to translate into another language (e.g., archival description).
3. You have two choices for doing the same thing:
*  click :term:`edit button` and then navigate to the language icon in the
   header bar and select the language you wish to translate your content into
   or,
*  navigate to the language icon in the header bar and then click :term:`edit
   button`

4. In this example, the language selected for translation is French and the
   user is translating content in an archival description. Note the
   :term:`translation bar` is visible at the bottom of the page.
   Ignore it for now.
5. Begin translating the content of the archival description in
   :term:`edit mode` by selecting one of the :term:`information area` and
   typing into the data entry :term:`fields`. Note that the content is shown
   in the source language above the data entry :term:`field`.

.. TIP:
   The tooltips (e.g., ISAD) will be shown in the new language because they
   have been translated as part of the AtoM application using `Transifex
   instructions.<https://docs.google.com/document/d/146wc1rmnqwouSFBAxaZEiL8aVWuNwOgRlrHq26oIIbk/edit>1__

6. Repeat for each field as required.
7. Click the save button in the :term:`button block`
8. AtoM returns the user to the :term:`view mode`. The translated fields will
   now appear in the new language of translation. Any content not yet
   translated will continue to appear in the source language.
