Accessions
==========

Accessions form an important first step in gaining physical and intellectual
control over the resources held by an :term:`archival institution` or other
form of :term:`repository`. "Accession" tends to be used as both a noun and a
verb - here are some definitions adapted from the `SAA Glossary
<http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/accession>`__:

* *An accession* is made up of materials physically and legally transferred
  to a :term:`repository` as a unit, which will be processed by staff and added
  to the institutions' holdings. In AtoM, an accession implies the first
  deposit of materials - accessions added to an existing :term:`fonds` or
  :term:`collection` are known as :term:`accruals <accrual>`.
* *To accession* something is to take legal and physical custody of a group of
  :term:`records <record>` or other materials and to formally document their
  receipt. This helps maintain the chain of custody over the records required
  to maintain their authenticity over time.

The :term:`accession record` is the means by which the accessioning process is
documented - an accession record is an administrative and descriptive document
that summarizes standard information about the process of transferring
materials to a repository, including information about the provenance,
contents and legal and physical transfer of the records such as, rights and
restrictions. It often precedes arrangement and description, and can be used
as the basis for the creation of an :term:`archival description` once the
materials have been arranged.

---------------------------------------------------

Users have the option of linking a new :term:`accession record` with an
existing :term:`archival description` in the AtoM database. The  Archival
description :term:`information area` is located at the bottom of the accession
record :term:`edit page`. Placing the cursor in the data :term:`field` will
activate a drop-down list of all archival descriptions entered into the
database. The User selects the appropriate :term:`archival description` by
moving through the list (a blue highlight will indicate which record you are
selecting). Then Save the record by clicking "Save" in the :term:`button
block` at the bottom of the accession :term:`edit page`.

.. _add-accession-accrual:

Add an accrual
==============

An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description  already
held by a :term:`repository`" (ISAD glossary). AtoM users with edit
permissions can add an accrual to an existing :term:`accession record`. To do
so:

1. Navigate to the :term:`accession record` to which you would like to add an
   :term:`accrual`. Instructions on how to do so are outlined above in
   :ref:`Edit an existing accession record <edit-accession-record>`.

2. When you have selected the :term:`accession record`, scroll to the bottom
   of the :term:`view page` and click the "Add accrual" button in the
   :term:`button block`.

3. You will be redirected to an accession record :term:`edit page`, but but at
   the top of the edit template a message will read: **"You are creating an
   accrual of the accession YYY-MM-DD/#."** (where YYYY-MM-DD/# represents the
   Accession number to which you are adding an accrual)

4. The edit template provided for the :term:`accrual` is the same as that of a
   new :term:`accession record`. Add data as required. See :ref:`Add a new
   accession record <add-new-accession>` above for more information on working
   with the accession record template.

5. After completing the new :term:`accrual` information in the :term:`edit
   page`, click on "Create" in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the
   page. Your new data will be saved, and you will be redirected to a
   :term:`view page` where you can review your work.

6. When viewing the :term:`accession record` for the :term:`accrual`, you will
   notice that in the Administrative :term:`information area` an "Accrual to"
   data field shows the related original accession record. The data is a
   hyperlink that can be clicked to navigate to the original :term:`accession
   record`.

7. Alternatively, if a User views the original :term:`accession record`, in
   the Administrative area an "Accruals" data field shows the related
   :term:`accrual`.


.. NOTE::

   An :term:`accrual` cannot be added to an accrual - it must belong to the
   original accession record. Therefore, If a User views the accession record
   of an accrual, the "Add accrual" button is not available in the
   :term:`button block`. If the accession record is an original however, the
   "Add accrual" button is available in the :term:`button block`. There is no
   limit to how many accruals can be added to an original
   :term:`accession record`.

.. _add-legacy-accession:

Add a legacy accession record
=============================

Users who have recently migrated to AtoM, or are catching up on a backlog of
accessions, may need to add new :term:`accession records <accession record>`
that have older dates encoded in the accession number. There are two ways
this can be done in AtoM - however, both require that a user have
:term:`administrator` access to the application.

Method 1: CSV Import
--------------------

AtoM offers :term:`administrators <administrator>` the ability to import data
in multiple formats including CSV (comma separated value) import. Accession
records can be imported via CSV using the Accession record CSV template
provided for users on the AtoM wiki; further instructions are included in the
AtoM Administrator's Manual under CSV Import. The accessions CSV import
method has no restrictions on the accession number formatting - consequently,
users can import multiple legacy accession records at once using this method.

* For more information on importing descriptions and terms via CSV in this
  manual, see: :ref:`CSV import <csv-import>`

Method 2: Altering the Accessions mask
--------------------------------------

Users interested in creating an :term:`accession record` that has a legacy
accession number associated with it via the AtoM :term:`user interface`, can
do so by first editing the  Accessions mask in the **Admin > Settings >
Global** area, and then creating a :ref:`new accession record <add-new-
accession>`.

By default, AtoM creates the accession record identifier as a unique number
compiled from [**YEAR MONTH DAY Incremental#**] - this is denoted in the
Global settings "Accession mask" as *%Y-%m-%d/#i*. A fixed value can be
entered for any of the date variables (year, month, day) used in the accession
mask, to create a number of legacy accessions from the same year and month,
for example.

**EXAMPLE**

To create a number of accessions from October 1998, an :term:`administrator`
could edit the Accession mask like so: **1998-10/#i**

If the changes are saved in **Admin > Settings > Global**, then when a user
next creates a :ref:`new accession record <add-new-accession>`, the accession
number will read:

* 1998-10/1

And the following accession record's identifier (accession number) will read:

* 1998-10/2

.. warning::

   These changes will stay in effect until an :term:`administrator` returns
   to the global settings menu via **Admin > Settings > Global** and returns
   the Accession mask to the default setting. Don't forget to do this, or all
   your new accessions will appear to be legacy accessions!

:ref:`Back to top <accession-records>`

.. _create-accession-description:

Create an archival description from an accession record
=======================================================

After you create a :ref:`new accession record <add-new-accession>`, you can
create an :term:`archival description` by clicking on the button "Create
Archival description" in the :term:`button block`.

Archival descriptions can be generated from an :term:`accession record` at
any time; it does not have to be at the time of creation. To create an
:term:`archival description` from an existing accession record, follow the
first steps outlined in :ref:`Edit an existing accession record
<edit-accession-record>` to browse existing accession records and select the
one that you would like to use.

The accession record is not aimed at end-user description, but AtoM provides
the option to create an archival description from an accession record to
prevent uneccessary re-entry of existing data an improve a user's workflow.
The following archival description :term:`fields <field>` inherit the data
entered into the :term:`accession record`:

* Title
* Name of creator(s)
* Archival/custodial history
* Scope & content
* Physical condition

Name access points (drawn from creators) and Rights added to the accession
record are also inherited into the archival description.

When you navigate to the :term:`accession record` you want to work with:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the accession record's :term:`view page`.
2. Click the "Create archival description" button located in the
   :term:`button block`.
3. AtoM will generate an :term:`archival description` using the fields listed
   above, and then will take you to the new description's :term:`view page`.
   You can see that the data you entered into the accession record fields:
   title, name of creator, archival/custodial history, scope & content and
   physical condition are all inherited into the archival description. If you
   added rights to the accession they are also inherited.
4. The new :term:`archival description` is saved as a :term:`draft record` -
   the title of the new description is derived from the data entered into the
   title :term:`field` of the originating :term:`accession record`.
5. The :term:`archival description` can now be edited by clicking on the
   "Edit" button in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the
   description's :term:`view page`. For more information on editing an
   archival description, see: :ref:`Edit an existing archival description
   <edit-archival-description>`.
6. A link to the original :term:`accession record` is maintained in the
   Accession :term:`information area` in the archival description. Similarly,
   a link to the archival description is added to the related :term:`accession
   record`. These are hyperlinks; clicking them in either record will take the
   user to the related record.

.. NOTE::

   Logged-in users with permissions can select the hyperlink accession record
   identifier and AtoM will take them to the related accession record
   :term:`view page`. Unauthenticated users (i.e. those who are not logged in)
   will not be able to see the Accessions area in the archival
   description, and they will not be able to access the Accessions module;
   logged-in Users without permissions can see the hyperlink but cannot
   access the :term:`accession record`.

.. _delete-accession-record:

Delete an accession record
==========================

To delete an :term:`accession record` in AtoM:

1. Navigate to the accession record you want to edit. You can locate all
   accessions in AtoM by clicking on "Manage" in the :term:`main menu`
   (located in the AtoM :term:`header bar`) and selecting "Accessions" from
   the :term:`drop-down menu`. For more information on navigation in AtoM, see
   :ref:`Access content <access-content>`. For more information on locating
   :term:`accession records <accession record>` in AtoM, see the :ref:`Edit an
   existing accession record <edit-accession-record>` section above.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the selected accession record's :term:`view page`,
   where the :term:`button block` is located.
3. If you click on the "Delete" button, AtoM will offer a warning. If the
   accession has accruals associated with it this will be noted in the warning
   message - accruals will not be deleted with an accession, and must be
   deleted separately
4. If you choose to proceed and click "Confirm" the entire accession record
   will be **permanently deleted**. Clicking "Cancel" will return a user to
   the :term:`accession record` :term:`view page`.

.. NOTE::

   Instead of permanently deleting an :term:`accession record` we recommend
   creating a :term:`deaccession record`. This way all records created by the
   :term:`archival institution` or :term:`repository` can be preserved for
   future reference.

   For more information on creating a deaccession record, see:
   :ref:`Add a new deaccession record <add-deaccession-record>`
