Archival Descriptions
=====================

Archival descriptions are one of the core :doc:`entity types
<../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with invaluable
contextual infomation about the resources held by an :term:`archival
institution`.

In AtoM, an archival description is a body of information about an archival
record or records. The descriptions provide contextual information about the
archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical levels (:term:`fonds`,
series, files, items, and variations of these in accordance with institutional
standards).

Archival desription is *also* an activity, however - generally accompanied by
the process of archival arrangemenent, it is the outcome of a process to gain
intellectual control over a resource or collection of resources and provide
end users (such as :term:`researchers <researcher>`) with a means of
conceptualizing the organization of these resources and navigating to the
specific content in which they are interested, as well as a sense of what is
contained, how it got there, and what role it serves in the larger
accumulation of materials. Archival description is therefore intended to
facilitate the identification, management, and understanding of archival
materials.

The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines
an archival description as *"The creation of an accurate representation of a
unit of description and its component parts, if any, by capturing, analyzing,
organizing and recording information that serves to identify, manage, locate
and explain archival materials and the context and records systems which
produced it. This term also describes the products of the process"* (ISAD
glossary).

Archival description is somewhat similar to the process of bibliographic
description, and some standards, such as the Canadian Rules for Archival
Description (RAD), are derived from bibliographic standards. Daniel Pitti,
one of the original creators of the Encoded Archival Description XML-based
metadata exchange standard (`EAD <http://www.loc.gov/ead/>`__), points out that
one of the key differences, however, is in the hierarchical nature of
archival description:

    *The distinction between what and for whom libraries and archives remember
    accounts form the major differences in archival and bibliographic
    description. A bibliographic description, such as that found in a MARC
    record, represents an individual published item, and thus is item-level.
    There is a one-to-one correspondence between the description and the item.
    The description is based on, and is derived from, the physical item.
    Archival description represents a fonds, a complex body of materials,
    frequently in more than one form or medium, sharing a common provenance.
    The description involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis.
    It begins by describing the whole, then proceeds to identify and describe
    sub-components of the whole, and sub-components of sub-components, and so
    on. Frequently, but by no means always, the description terminates with a
    description of individual items. The description emphasizes the
    intellectual structure and content of the material, rather than their
    physical characteristics.* (`Pitti, 1999
    <http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november99/11pitti.html>`__)

Archival description is often preceded by the creation of an :ref:`accession
record <accession-records>`, and much of the information generated during the
accessions process can be re-used to create archival descriptions. As new
:term:`accruals <accrual>` are added, the archival description is updated to
reflect these changes.

.. TIP::

   AtoM can generate an :term:`archival description` from an existing
   :term:`accession record` - see :ref:`Create an archival description from an
   accession record <create-accession-description>` for more information.

.. _add-archival-description:

Add a new archival description
==============================

This section contains instructions on how to Add a new top level archival
description (also known as a :term:`parent record`), and how to add a new
child description (or :term:`child record`) via two different methods

.. _add-top-level-description:

Add a new top level description
-------------------------------

A new :term:`archival description` can be added at any time, from anywhere in
the application, via the :term:`main menu` available to authenticated (i.e.
logged in) AtoM users with the appropriate privileges (such as
:term:`contributors <contributor>`, :term:`editors <editor>`, and
:term:`administrators <administrator>`). For more information on User roles
and types of users in AtoM see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

.. NOTE::

   You must be logged in to be able to create a new :term:`archival
   description` in AtoM. See: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

**To create a new archival description:**

#. In the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`, click the "Add"
   menu and select "Archival description" from the :term:`drop-down menu`.
#. AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry.

.. NOTE::

   The edit page that appears will depend on the :ref:`default template
   <default-template>` set in the application. When first installed, the
   default template in AtoM is the :ref:`ISAD(G) <isad-template>` (General
   International Standard for Archival Description) template. Administrators
   can change the default template to any of the other 4 supported standards
   (:ref:`RAD <rad-template>`, :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>`, :ref:`Dublin Core
   <dublin-core-template>`, or :ref:`MODS <mods-template>` via **Admin >
   Settings > Default template**. For more information, see: :doc:`Settings
   <../administer/settings>`.

3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   :term:`information area` to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under
   it. Enter data as required.
4. Note that new lower :term:`levels of description <level of description>`
   (i.e. :term:`children <child record>`) can be created on the fly without
   leaving the top-level or :term:`parent <parent record>` description you are
   currently creating. For more information, see below, :ref:`Add a new child
   description <method-1-child-description>`.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved,
   and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away from
   the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will also
   result in no new record being created.
6. To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create button>`
   located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. NOTE::

   The default status of a newly created :term:`archival description` is
   DRAFT. :term:`Draft records <draft record>` are not visible to
   unauthenticated (i.e. not logged in) users such as :term:`researchers
   <researcher>`. Under the :term:`Administration area` of the archival
   description, users with publication privileges (see: :ref:`User roles
   <user-roles>`) can select :term:`PUBLISHED <published record>` as the new
   status of the archival description, making it available for read access to
   the public.

.. TIP::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can also change the default
   publication status of new records throughout the application via **Admin >
   Settings > Global > Default publication status**. For more information,
   see: :doc:`Settings <../administer/settings>`.

:ref:`Back to top <archival-descriptions>`


.. _add-child-archival-description:

Add a new child description
---------------------------

A :term:`child descriptions <child record>` is an archival description that is
part of a larger hierarchy, often a :term:`fonds` or :term`collection`. A
child record refers to a description of the :term:`archival unit` that is one
:term:`level of description` lower than the current unit - for example, if a
series belongs to a :term:`fonds`, the series is the child record of the
fonds. AtoM helps users understand the context of the materials by depicting
the current record's position in the treeview, which can also be used for
navigation  (see: :doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>`)

There are two ways to add a new :term:`child description <child record>` in
AtoM - **Method 1** allows a user to add a new child record "on the fly" while
creating a top-level description (or :term:`parent record`), but these records
should be considered stubs or placeholders until they can be returned to and
supplemented with further description. **Method 2** explains how to create a
full child description at any time.

.. _method-1-child-description:

METHOD 1: "On the fly"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AtoM includes a data entry element in the first :term:`information area` of
the :term:`archival description` :term:`edit page` that allows users to
generate lower :term:`levels of description <level of description>` to a
:term:`parent record` without leaving the current :term:`edit page`.

This area is located in:

* The **Identity** :term:`area <information area>` of the :ref:`ISAD(G)
  <isad-template>`  and :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>` templates
* The **Statement of responsibility** :term:`area <information area>` of the
  :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` template
* The **Elements** :term:`area <information area>` of the :ref:`Dublin Core
  <dublin-core-template>`  and :ref:`MODS <mods-template>` templates

Note that this method is not meant to replace more granular description - it
allows a user to create a sort of skeleton structure to the whole of the
description (such as a :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`), which can
improve supplement an archival arrangement workflow - the child descriptions
can then be supplemented later.

Fields provided for creating lower levels of description "on the fly" via the
:term:`parent description's <parent record>` :term:`edit page` include:

* Identifier (i.e., reference number)
* Level (of description)
* Title

.. TIP::

   You can add as many levels as needed at one time; for example, to add
   multiple series to a fonds or collection, fill in the fields under the "Add
   new child levels" and add as many lower levels as desired. When the record
   is saved, you will be able to see the new :term:`child records <child
   record>` in the :term:`context menu`.

.. _method-2-child-description

METHOD 2: Adding a full child description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Full :term:`child descriptions <child record>` can be added to an archival
description at any time (by users with sufficient edit privileges) by
navigating to the description to which you would like to add a child (the
:term:`parent description <parent record>`).

First, navigate to the :term:`parent archival description <parent record>` to
which you wish to add a child description. You can do this by :ref:`browsing
<../access-content/browse>` or :ref:`searching <../access-content/search>` for
the :term:`archival description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>`
for more information on navigation in AtoM.

.. NOTE::

   You must be logged in to be able to create a new :term:`archival
   description` in AtoM. See: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

#. In the :term:`view page` of the parent :term:`archival description`, scoll
   to the bottom of the record to the :term:`button block` and click the "Add
   new" button.
#. You will be redirected to a new :term:`archival description` :term:`edit
   page`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   It is important to note that after clicking on the "Add new" record button,
   the edit archival description template will appear, but no reference is
   made to the :term:`parent <parent record>` archival description. When you
   save your record, however, you will be able to see the relationship
   expressed in the treeview, located in the :term:`context menu` on the left-
   hand side of the :term:`view page`.

3. Enter appropriate information into the template for the lower-level
   description, and remember to select the :term:`level of description`.
4. Note that you can add further :term:`children <child record>` to this lower
   level of description as you work, via The :ref:`"On the fly"
   <method-1-child-description>` method described above.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved,
   and no new child record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
6. To save the new child record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create
   button>` located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

After clicking "Save" you will be redirected to the :term:`view page` for the
new child description. You can see the relationship to the parent record
expressed in the :term:`context menu`.




:ref:`Back to top <archival-descriptions>`

.. _edit-archival-description:

Edit an existing archival description
=====================================

An authenticated (i.e. logged in) user with edit privileges can edit or update
an :term:`archival description` at any time. For more information on edit
privileges and user roles see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. For information
on logging in, see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`.

**To edit an existing archival description:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival description` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :ref:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :ref:`searching <../access-content/search>` for the :term:`archival
   description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   information area to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under it
4. Add and/or revise data as required.
5. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   archival description.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record.

You will be redirected to the :term:`view page` for the edited
:term:`archival description`, where you can review your work.


.. _publish-archival-description:

Publish an archival description
-------------------------------

All new and imported :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` in
AtoM are automatically saved as :term:`draft records <draft record>`. This
means that users who are not authenticated (i.e. logged in) cannot view these
records.

Publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level of description`,
meaning that changes to the publication status of the :term:`parent record`
will affect the publication status of all :term:`child records <child
record>`. For example, when a :term:`fonds` description is changed from draft
to published, all child levels within the fonds (series, files, items, etc.)
are automatically changed as well.

If a :term:`contributor` (i.e. a logged in user **without** permission to
publish descriptions - see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`) edits a
:term:`published record`, the record's status is **automatically changed back
to draft**

Changing a record's status to published allows unauthenticated users such as
:term:`researchers <researcher>` the ability to see the record, i.e. read
access is granted to the public. Draft records are not viewable by
unauthenticated users (i.e. those not logged in).


**To publish an existing archival description**

1. Navigate to the record you wish to publish. For more information on
   navigation in AtoM, see: :ref:`Access content <access-content>`
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking "Edit"
   button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking on one of the
   :term:`information area` headings; this takes you to the record's
   :term:`edit page`.
3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on the
   :term:`Administration area` heading to expand it and make changes.
4. In the :term:`drop-down menu` underneath the subheading "Publication
   status", select "published"
5. Scroll down to the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the :term:`edit
   page` and click the "Save" button

The archival description, and any lower :term:`levels of description <level of
description>` associated with it, will now be published - public users who are
not logged will now be granted read access to view (but not edit) the
record(s). The record(s) will also be discoverable to public users via
:ref:`browse <../access-content/browse>` or :ref:`search
<../access-content/search>`



:ref:`Back to top <archival-descriptions>`


.. _duplicate-archival-description:

Duplicate an existing archival description
==========================================

To simplify the description workflow when working with many similar
descriptions (such as, in some cases, many items in a :term:`collection`),
AtoM includes the ability to generate a duplicate record from an existing
:term:`archival description`, and then edit it to make necessary changes.
This can allow a user to avoid unnecessarily repeating data entry.

**To duplicate an existing archival description:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival description` you wish to edit. You
   can do this by :ref:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or
   :ref:`searching <../access-content/search>` for the :term:`archival
   description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>` for more
   information on navigation in AtoM.
2. At the bottom of the archival description, click the "Duplicate" button
   located in the :term:`button block`.
3. You will be redirected to a new screen with an :term:`edit page` of an
   :term:`archival description` open.
4. The new edit page provides a warning at the top to indicate that it is a
   duplicated record.
5. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   information area to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under it.
   You will note that these will be populated with the exact same data found
   in the original :term:`archival description` - you can now make any edits
   or revisions necessary.
6. You can quit the create process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button
   in the :term:`button block`; no new record will be created. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Create"** will also result in no new record being created.
7. To save the duplicate as a new record, click the "Save" button located in
   the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. IMPORTANT::

   If you are duplicating a :term:`child <child record>` of a :term:`parent
   record` (such as a series, file, or item), the duplicate description will
   automatically be created as a :term:`child <child record>` of the same
   parent :term:`archival description`. If you duplicate a top or
   :term:`parent <parent record>` :term:`level of description`, the new
   record will also be a top-level description with no parent.

   Records can be moved in AtoM as well - see below,
   :ref:`Move an archival description <move-archival-description>`


:ref:`Back to top <archival-descriptions>`


.. _move-archival-description:

Move an archival description
============================

Occasionally a user will need to move an archival description from one level
of description to another, from one fonds to another, or simply to change the
sort order within a number of records that share the same :term:`level of
description` (sometimes called siblings). There are two methods of moving
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - the first method
allows only for changing the sort order in the treeview found in the
:term:`context menu`, while the second method, more robust, allows for a
record to be moved broadly throughout the application, even allowing a lower
level of description to be moved so that it becomes a new :term:`parent
description <parent record>`.


Method 1: Change sort order
---------------------------

.. IMPORTANT::

   This method only applies when there are multiple :term:`children
   <child record>` with the same :term:`level of description` beneath a
   :term:`parent description <parent record>` - i.e. "siblings". It will
   change the sort order as displayed in the treeview found in the
   :term:`context menu` of the related descriptions.

1. Navigate to the :term:`child description <child record>` whose sort order
   you wish to change. You can do this by :ref:`browsing <../access-
   content/browse>` or:ref:`searching <../access-content/search>` for the
   :term:`archival description` - see :ref:`Access content <access-content>`
   for more information on navigation in AtoM.
