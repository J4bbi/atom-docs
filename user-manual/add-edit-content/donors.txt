Donor records
=============

The `SAA Glossary <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`__ defines a donor as
"*An individual or organization who gives property or money to another without
reciprocal compensation,*" adding that in many instances, "*individuals who
donate collections are not the provenance of the collection.*" This implies
that a donor is not nessarily the :term:`creator` of the materials being
donated to a :term:`repository` - rather, they are the last legal custodian of
the records before they are passed to a :term:`repository` for long-term
preservation.

In AtoM, donor records can be used more generically than the SAA Glossary
defintion - they can be used to manage records of all individuals who supply
records and other materials to a repository, whether freely or with the
expectation of compensation. They are a way to maintain a record of the
provenance of :ref:`accessions <accession-records>`, so that donors can be
contacted in the future if necessary. Donor records can be created
independently; more often they are added while creating an :term:`accession
record` via the :term:`donor dialog` that is available in the accession
record edit template.

**Below are instructions for using the Donors module in AtoM to:**

* :ref:`Add a new donor record <add-donor-record>`
* :ref:`Edit an existing donor record <edit-donor-record>`
* :ref:`Link a donor record to an accession <link-donor-accession>`
* :ref:`Delete a donor record <delete-donor-record>`

**SEE ALSO**

* :ref:`Accessions <accession-records>`

.. _add-donor-record:

Add a new donor record
======================

In AtoM, there are currently 2 ways to add a new Donor record:

* :ref:`Using the donor dialog in the accessions template
  <add-donor-via-accession>`
* :ref:`From another donor record <add-donor-via-donor>`

.. TIP::

   Want a quicker way to add a new donor? AtoM menus are customizable; you
   can add a link to Donors in the :term:`main menu` under **Add > Donor**.
   To do so, you will require an :term:`administrator` account - navigate to
   **Admin > Menus**, and click the "Add new" button at the bottom of the
   page. Add the following information to each field in the menu template:

   * **Name:** addDonor
   * **Label:** Donor
   * **Parent:** --add
   * **Path:** donor/add

   A link to a new Donor record edit template will now appear in the
   :term:`main menu` under **Add > Donor**. For more information on working
   with menus in AtoM, see: :ref:`Manage menus <manage-menus>`.
