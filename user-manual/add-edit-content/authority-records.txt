Authority records
=================

Authority records are one of the core :doc:`entity types
<../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with a means to control
the representation of information about actors - :term:`corporate bodies
<corporate body>`, persons, or families - who interact with archival
materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. Typically, authority
records contain information about the authorized form of name and other forms
of name by which the actor is known, dates of existence, relevant adminstrtive
or biographical history details, and other contextual information;
additionally, roles in :term:`events <event>` and relationships with archival
materials are also captured and expressed.

The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines
an authority record as "*The authorized form of name combined with other
information elements that identify and describe the named entity and may also
point to other related authority records.*" Maintaining contextual
information about records :term:`creators <creator>` and other actors is
essential to archival practice, and helps establish the provenance and
authenticity of the related records. Additionally, archival authority records,
like library authority records, can be used to control the creation and use of
:term:`access points <access point>`, thereby improving access for
:term:`researchers <researcher>` and other members of the public. By
maintaining authority records separately from :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`, complex relationships of creation and contribution
can be expressed, even between materials held by different :term:`archival
institutions <archival institution>` or in different kinds of
:term:`repositories <repository>` such as libraries and museums. By using a
recognized international standard to control the creation of authority
records, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` have the
opportunity to share authority records. As the `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__
notes,

      "*Such standardization is of particular international benefit when the
      sharing or linking of contextual information is likely to cross national
      boundaries. The multinational character of past and present record
      keeping creates the incentive for international standardization which
      will support the exchange of contextual information. For example,
      processes such as colonialization, immigration and trade have
      contributed to the multinational character of recordkeeping.*" (ISAAR
      Introduction)

In AtoM, the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to describe
authority records are based on the `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__

Persons and Families* (`ISAAR <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-
