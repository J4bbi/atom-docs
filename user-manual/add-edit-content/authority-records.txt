Authority records
=================

Authority records are one of the core :doc:`entity types
<../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with a means to control
the representation of information about actors - :term:`corporate bodies
<corporate body>`, persons, or families - who interact with archival
materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. Typically, authority
records contain information about the authorized form of name and other forms
of name by which the actor is known, dates of existence, relevant adminstrtive
or biographical history details, and other contextual information;
additionally, roles in :term:`events <event>` and relationships with archival
materials are also captured and expressed.

The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines
an authority record as "*The authorized form of name combined with other
information elements that identify and describe the named entity and may also
point to other related authority records.*" Maintaining contextual
information about records :term:`creators <creator>` and other actors is
essential to archival practice, and helps establish the provenance and
authenticity of the related records. Additionally, archival authority records,
like library authority records, can be used to control the creation and use of
:term:`access points <access point>`, thereby improving access for
:term:`researchers <researcher>` and other members of the public. By
maintaining authority records separately from :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`, complex relationships of creation and contribution
can be expressed, even between materials held by different :term:`archival
institutions <archival institution>` or in different kinds of
:term:`repositories <repository>` such as libraries and museums. By using a
recognized international standard to control the creation of authority
records, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` have the
opportunity to share authority records. As the `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__
notes,

      "*Such standardization is of particular international benefit when the
      sharing or linking of contextual information is likely to cross national
      boundaries. The multinational character of past and present record
      keeping creates the incentive for international standardization which
      will support the exchange of contextual information. For example,
      processes such as colonialization, immigration and trade have
      contributed to the multinational character of recordkeeping.*" (ISAAR
      Introduction)

In AtoM, the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to describe
authority records are based on the `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__
*International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies,
Persons and Families* (`ISAAR <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf-
international-standard-archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons-

.. _create-authority-record:

Create a new authority record
=============================

The `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__ model of authority record use and
maintenance means that separate records are created for all actors (persons,
families, and :term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`), which can then be
linked to related :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. In AtoM
this process has been automated wherever possible to simplify the workflow -
consequently, a new :term:`authority record` is automatically created any time
a new name (such as a :term:`creator` name or a name :term:`access point`) is
associated with a description. This means that there are several different
ways to create new authority records:

* :ref:`From the main menu <add-authority-main>`
* :ref:`From a related archival description <add-authority-description>`
* :ref:`From an authority record view page <add-authority-view-page>`

.. NOTE::

   To create new authority records, you must be logged in to AtoM with a
   :term:`user account` with sufficient edit permissions to create authority
   records, such as an :term:`administrator`, :term:`editor`, or
   :term:`contributor`. For more information on types of users and edit
   permissions, see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`

.. _add-authority-main:

Add a new authority record from the main menu
---------------------------------------------

1. In the :term:`main menu`, click the "Add" button (represented by the + icon
   in the :term:`main menu`) and select "Authority record". Alternatively,
   navigate to an authority record view page and click the :term:`"Add new"
   button <add new button>` in the :term:`button block`. AtoM takes you to a
   blank edit page for data entry.
2. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   :term:`information area` to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under
   it.
3. Enter data as required. The authority record edit template is based on the
   `ICA's <http://www.ica.org/>`__ *International Standard Archival Authority
   Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (`ISAAR
   <http://www.ica.org/10203/standards/isaar-cpf- international-standard-
   archival-authority-record-for-corporate-bodies-persons- and-families-2nd-
   edition.html>`__). For more information on the use of particular fields in
   the ISAAR authority record edit template, see: :ref:`ISAAR(CPF)
   <isaar-template>`.
4. You can quit the creation process at any time by clicking the "Cancel"
   button in the :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be
   saved, and no new record will be created. Note that simply navigating away
   from the page by any other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will
   also result in no new record being created.
5. To save the new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <create button>`
   located in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

Once the new :term:`authority record` is saved, you will be redirected to the
record's :term:`view page`, where you can review your work. Clicking "Edit"
in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record will re-open the
authority record in :term:`edit mode`.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Currently, there is no "Draft" publication status for an :term:`authority
   record` in AtoM. This means that as soon as you create an authority record,
   it will be visible to public users (i.e. unauthenticated users who are not
   logged in). Unauthenticated users will not have access to the
   :term:`button block`, and cannot edit the record.

.. _add-authority-description:

Add a new authority record from a related archival description
--------------------------------------------------------------

In AtoM, whenever a new name is added to an archival description (generally,
either as a :term:`creator` or as a subject by adding a name :term:`access
point`), an authority record is automatically created for the new name. AtoM
:term:`creator` names and name :term:`access points  <access point>` are added
via a :term:`value list` that appears in a :term:`drop-down menu` - as you type
data into the :term:`field`, the value list will narrow its options to present
related suggestions. If an authority record already exists, you can select the
name from the values and a link will be created. If no authority record
already exists, however, new names can be added "on the fly" in these fields:

* :ref:`Creator names <authority-record-creator-names>`
* :ref:`Name access points <authority-record-name-access>`

.. _authority-record-creator-names:

Creator names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever a new :term:`creator` name is added to an archival description, a
new :term:`authority record` for that name will be generated when the
:term:`archival description` is saved. Because each edit template uses
different labels for the field to add a new creator, template specific
instructions have been included below.

**ISAD(G) edit template**

* In the "Context :term:`area <information area>`" of the ISAD(G) edit
  template, enter a new name in the :term:`field` named "Name of creator(s)."
* The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record` when you save the
  :term:`archival description`.

**Rules for Archival Description (RAD) edit template**

* In the "Dates of creation" :term:`information area` of the RAD edit
  template, click the "Add new" button that appears under the heading, "Add
  new name and/or date(s)."
* A dialog will appear with several fields, including "Actor name," "Event
  type," "Date," etc.
* Enter a new name in the "Actor name" field of the pop-up dialog, and then
  click "Submit". The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record`
  when you save the :term:`archival description`.

**Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) edit template**

* In the "Identity elements" :term:`information area`, navigate to the "Name
  of creator(s)" section, and enter a new name. The name will be saved as a
  new :term:`authority record` when you save the :term:`archival description`.

**Dublin Core Version 1.1 (DC) edit template**

* In the Dublin Core template, there is only one main :term:`information
  area`, in which a section called "Name(s)" appears, close to the top of the
  record's :term:`edit page`.
* Navigate to the "Name(s)" section, and under the :term:`field` labelled
  "Actor name," enter a new  name.
* The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record` when you save the
  :term:`archival description`.

**Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) edit template**

* In the MODS template, there is only one main :term:`information area`, in
  which a section called "Names and origin info" appears, close to the top of
  the record's :term:`edit page`.
* Navigate to the "Names" and origin info section, and click the "Add new"
  button that appears under the heading, "Add new name and/or date(s)."
* Enter a new name in the "Actor name" field of the pop-up dialog, and then
  click "Submit". The name will be saved as a new :term:`authority record`
  when you save the :term:`archival description`.

.. _authority-record-name-access:

Name access points
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`ISAD(G) <isad-template>`, :ref:`RAD <rad-template>`, and :ref:`DACS
<dacs-template>` content standards support the inclusion of name
:term:`accesss points <access point>` in :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`; consequently, an "Access points" :term:`information
area` with a :term:`field` for name :term:`access points <access point>` has
been included on these templates.

This field can be used to create an :term:`authority record` for a person,
family, or :term:`corporate body` who is the subject of an archival
description, but not its :term:`creator`. Type a new name into a Name
:term:`access point` :term:`field`. When you save the :term:`archival
description` record, AtoM creates a new :term:`authority record` for the
name.
