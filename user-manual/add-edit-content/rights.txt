Rights
======

As discussed in the section on entity types,
:term:`Rights records <rights record>` provide rights related restrictions
that can be linked to :term:`accession records <accession record>`,
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` and
:term:`digital objects <digital object>`. AtoM Rights metadata elements use
`PREMIS rights elements <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`__. In AtoM
restrictions can be based on Copyright(s), License, Statute(s) and Policy.
You can also include rights restrictions based on guidelines set by the
Donor of the records. Rights are inherited in AtoM, which means that rights
added at a higher level (e.g., fonds level) are inherited by the lower levels
(e.g., item level). If you add rights to an
:term:`accession record`, all
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` created from that
accession will inherit the same rights. If you add rights to an
:term:`archival description` at the :term:`fonds` or
:term:`collections <collection>` level, all lower levels (aka
:term:`child records <child record>`) such as the file or item-level will
inherit those rights.

Add a new rights record

This section describes how to add a new :term:`rights record` by using the
rights dialog provided through the add/edit template.
