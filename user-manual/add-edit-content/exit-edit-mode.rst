:term:`Edit mode <edit mode>` allows the user to add, modify, or delete the
contents of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions
<archival institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and other database content using
:term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In edit mode, AtoM displays all fields in a
:term:`record` for data entry.

Usually, when first viewing a page, a :term:`record` will be displayed in
:term:`view mode`, and the user will have to enter :term:`edit mode` by
either clicking the "Edit" button in the :term:`button block`, or by clicking
on an :term:`area header` above an :term:`information area` (the exception is
when a new record is being created via the |plus| :ref:`Add menu
<main-menu-add>` - in this case the user is redirected to a blank record
already in :term:`edit mode`.

**TO EXIT EDIT MODE**

The two primary ways to exit edit mode are to either **save** or **cancel** the
record (or changes made to an existing record), using the buttons found in
the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The **ONLY** way to save any changes made to a record is by using the
   "Save" or "Create" (if it is a new record) button in the :term:`button
   block`. All other methods will result in all changes to the record being
   lost.

If you do not wish you preserve your changes, you can simply navigate away
from the current record; no changes will be saved. Any of the following
example methods will result in no changes being saved:

1. Click "Cancel" in the :term:`button block` - AtoM will reload the record
   in :term:`view mode` without saving any changes. For more information on
   the button block, see: :ref:`recurring-button-block`.
2. Click the logo for the associated :term:`archival institution` in the
   context menu - AtoM will redirect you to the archival institution
   :term:`view page`. See: :ref:`recurring-institution-logos`.
3. Click the :term:`site logo` in the upper left-hand corner of the AtoM
   :term:`header bar` - AtoM will redirect you to the :term:`home page`. See:
   :ref:`Site logo <site-logo-element>`.
4. Open the :term:`browse menu` in the :term:`header bar` and select a type
   of record to browse - AtoM will redirect you to a browse page. See: the
   :ref:`Browse menu <browse-menu>` and :ref:`Browse <browse>`.
5. Use the :term:`search box` to perform a search - AtoM will return a search
   results page. See: the :ref:`Search box <search-box>`, and :doc:`Search
   <../access-content/search-atom>`.
6. Click a link in the :term:`main menu`, located in the AtoM :term:`header
   bar`, to perform some other action. For more information on the main menu,
   see: :ref:`main-menu`.
