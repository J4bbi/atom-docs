Archival Institutions
=====================

:term:`Archival institutions <archival institution>` are one of the core
:doc:`entity types <../overview/entity-types>` in AtoM and provide users with
the means of managing information about :term:`repositories <repository>`
and other institutions and organizations that hold archival materials or
other cultural heritage items and artifacts.

In AtoM, :term:`archival institution` descriptions are structured into
:term:`information areas <information area>` based on the `ICA's
<http://www.ica.org/>`__ *International Standard for
Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings* (:ref:`ISDIAH
<isdiah-template>`). The ISDIAH glossary describes an archival institution as:
*"An organization which keeps and preserves archival material and makes it
accessible to the public."* While generally targeted at institutions whose
primary function is to collect and keep archives and make them publicly
available, the ISDIAH introduction goes on to note that:


    *...other entities such as cultural institutions (libraries, museums),
    businesses, families or individuals may hold archives. This standard, or
    an appropriate subset of its elements, can be applied to all entities
    which provide access to the records they hold.*

Information captured in the :term:`archival institution` description template
is comprehensive, but relates specifically to the :term:`repository's
<repository>` role collecting and providing access to cultural heritage
materials. In addition to capturing identity and history information, the
ISDIAH standard provides information areas to record information about
collection policies,services offered, buildings, accessibility, and more.
Consequently, the :term:`archival institution` record should be considered
distinct from, but complementary to, that of an :term:`authority record`. The
ISDIAH Introduction notes that:

    *As corporate bodies, persons or families, the holders of archival
    materials may be described in ISAAR(CPF) compliant authority records
    including the appropriate elements of description as indicated in ISDIAH.
    Otherwise, the description of holders may be included in separate
    authority files.*

In AtoM, :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` can be linked to
:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` and the holdings of an
institution can be browsed even when AtoM is used as a :term:`multi-repository
system`. On all related :term:`archival description` :term:`view pages <view
page>`, the institition's name and logo will appear as hyperlinks to the
:term:`archival institution` record; similarly, an archival institution's page
will list its holdings as hyperlinks to related archival descriptions.
Institutions can also be themed in AtoM - when a background color is added to
the :term:`archival institution`, the same background color will appear behind
all related :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` to highlight
the relationship.

**Below are instructions for using the Archival institution module in AtoM

.. _add-archival-institution:

Add a new archival institution
==============================

This section contains instructions on how to Add a new :term:`archival
institution` :ref:`from the main menu <add-institution-main>`. There are three
main ways to add an archival institution record in AtoM - doing so via the
|plus| :ref:`"Add" <main-menu-add>` menu is the easiest, but to accommodate
different workflows, archival institution records can also be added from an
:term:`archival description` or from the :term:`view page` of another archival
institution. Below are instructions to add a new archival institution:

* :ref:`From the Add menu <add-institution-main>`
* :ref:`From the archival description edit page
  <add-institution-description-edit>`
* :ref:`From the archival institution view page <add-institution-view>`.

For specific information on the :term:`fields <field>` in the archival
institution's :term:`edit page`, see: :ref:`ISDIAH template
<isdiah-template>`

A new archival institution can be added at any time, from anywhere in the
application, via the :term:`main menu`.

.. NOTE::
   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` must be logged-in in order to add
   a new :term:`archival institution`. For more information on logging in,
   see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` for more
   informatin on groups and default permissions in AtoM.

**To create a new archival institution:**

1. In the :term:`main menu` located in the :term:`header bar`, click the |plus|
   :ref:`"Add" <main-menu-add>` menu and select "Archival institution" from the
   :term:`drop-down menu`.
2. AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry.
3. On loading, the :term:`edit page` displays the record with all
   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   :term:`information area` to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under
   it. Enter data as required.
4. You can quit the process at any time by clicking the "Cancel" button in the
   :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved and no new
   record will be added. Note that simply navigating away from the page by any
   other means, **without first clicking "Create"** will also result in no new
   record being created.
5. To save a new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <Create button>`
   in the :term:`button block` at the bottom of the record.

.. _edit-archival-institution:

Edit an existing archival institution
=====================================

This section contains instructions on how to Edit an existing :term:`archival
institution`, after it has been :ref:`created <add-archival-institution>`.
For information on how to theme your archival institution, see :ref:`below
<edit-institution-theme>`.

.. NOTE::
   Only an authenticated (i.e. logged in) :term:`administrator` user can edit or
   update an archival institution. For more information on edit privileges and
   user roles see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

An archival institution's description can be edited at any time.

**To edit an existing archival institution:**

1. First, navigate to the :term:`archival institution` you wish to edit. You can
   do this by :doc:`browsing <../access-content/browse>` or :doc:`searching
   <../access-content/search>` for the :term:`archival institution` by name. See
   :ref:`access content <access-content>` for more information on navigation in
   AtoM.
2. Switch from :term:`view mode` to :term:`edit mode` by clicking the
   :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block` located at
   the bottom of the record, or by clicking on one of the :term:`information
   area` headings; this takes you to the record's :term:`edit page`.

   :term:`information areas <information area>` closed; click on an
   information area to access the :term:`fields <field>` grouped under it.

   in the :term:`button block`; any changes made will not be saved. Note that
   simply navigating away from the page by any other means, **without first
   clicking "Save"** will also result in no changes being saved to the
   archival description.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record.

You will be redirected to the :term:`view page` for the edited :term:`archival
institution`, where you can review your work.
