Archival Institutions
=====================

:term:`Archival institution` descriptions are structured into :term:`information
areas <information area>` based on the ICA's International Standard for
Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH). The ISDIAH glossary
describes an archival institution as “An organization which keeps and
preserves archival material and makes it accessible to the public”. In AtoM,
the data elements used to describe such institutions are based on this
definition.

This section describes how to add, edit, and delete archival institutions. The
data entry pages listed below give detailed notes and explanations on every
field included on the edit page; wherenthere is a one-to-one correspondence
between an ISDIAH data element and an AtoM field, the note typically just
gives the ISDIAH rule verbatim.

.. NOTE:: Only an authenticated (i.e. logged in) :term:`administrator users
   <administrator>` can add, edit, update or delete an :term:`archival
   institution`. For more information on edit privileges and user roles see:
   :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`. For information on logging in, see: :ref:`Log
   in <log-in>`.

   :term:`drop-down menu`.

   .. NOTE::
      Adding an :term:`archival institution` will automatically create an
      :term:`authority record` for that institution; the two will be
      automatically linked. You must be logged in to be able to create a new
      archival description in AtoM.

2. AtoM takes you to a blank :term:`edit page` for data entry.

   :term:`button block`; any data already entered will not be saved and no new
   record will be added. Note that simply navigating away from the page by any
   other means, **without first clicking “Create”** will also result in no new
   record being created.
5. To save a new record, click the :term:`"Create" button <Create button>`

   :term:`"Edit" button <Edit button>` in the :term:`button block` located at
   the bottom of the record, or by clicking on one of the :term:`information
   area` headings; this takes you to the record's :term:`edit page`.

   archival description.
6. To save your edits, click the "Save" button located in the :term:`button
   block` at the bottom of the record.
