  About page
    The about page provides general information on AtoM. It can be reached
    via the :term:`header bar` at the top of all pages. The content of the
    about page can be edited by  :term:`administrators <administrator>`
    (see :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`).

  Accession record
    The accession record is an administrative and descriptive document that
    summarizes standard information about the process of transferring
    materials to a repository, including information about the provenance,
    contents and legal and physical transfer of the records such as, rights
    and restrictions. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and
    :ref:`Accessions <accession-records>`.

  Access point
    An access point is "A name, term, keyword, phrase or code that may be
    used to search, identify and locate an archival description." (ISAD
    glossary). In AtoM, access points are derived from :term:`authority
    records <authority record>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` created
    and customized by users. See :doc:`Terms </add-edit-content/terms>`.

  Access privilege
    Access privileges control the ways a user is able to interact with
    AtoM. For example, some users are able to add and edit content while
    others may only be able to search and browse content. Access
    privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles <user role>` (see
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`).

  Accrual
    An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description
    already held by a :term:`repository`." (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, an
    accrual can be added to an existing :term:`accession record`. See:
    :ref:`Accessions <accession-records>`.

  Add menu
    The "Add" menu allows authorized users to add new :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records
    <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and :term:`functions <function>`.
    Only logged-in users can see the "Add" menu.

  Add new button
    The add new button is located in the :term:`button block <button
    block>` of the :term:`view page <view page>` and allows users to add
    new records (:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, and :term:`terms <term>`) to
    AtoM.

  Admin menu
    The admin menu allows users with :term:`administrator <administrator>`
    access to customize AtoM to meet institution-specific requirements and
    to manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and :term:`user
    profiles <user profile>`. The admin menu is only visible to users with
    administrator privileges. See :ref:`Administer <administer>`.

  Administration area
    The Administration area is part of the resource description edit
    template. It allows the User to change the publication status of the
    resource - Draft (this resource description is not available for
    public viewing) and Published (this resource description is available
    for public viewing). It also allows the user to set a default
    :term:`display standard` for an :term:`archival description`.

  Administrator
    The administrator is a type of user who has :term:`access privileges
    <access privilege>` to do the following: install or uninstall AtoM;
    create, read, update, or delete any record; customize AtoM to
    institution-specific requirements or themes; and manage :term:`user
    accounts <user account>` and :term:`user profiles <user profile>` (see
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` and :ref:`Administer <administer>`).

  Advanced search
    The advanced search is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain
    text matching a search query. The advanced search hyperlink can be
    accessed in the drop-down that appears when a user places the cursor
    in the :term:`search box`. In the advanced search page, the user can
    select "and, or, not" operators, and search specific fields, to create
    a powerful search query. The option to apply filters to limit or
    narrow the search are also provided.

  Archival description
    An archival description is a body of information about an archival
    record or records. The descriptions provide contextual information
    about the archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical levels
    (:term:`fonds`, series, files, items, and variations of these in
    accordance with institutional standards).

    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines an archival description as "The creation of an accurate
    representation of a unit of description and its component parts, if
    any, by capturing, analyzing, organizing and recording information
    that serves to identify, manage, locate and explain archival materials
    and the context and records systems which produced it. This term also
    describes the products of the process" (ISAD glossary).

    In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used for describing
    archival records are derived from the ICA's *General International
    Standard Archival Description* (ISAD). See :doc:`Entity types
    <../overview/entity-types>` and :ref:`Archival descriptions
    <archival-descriptions>`.

  Archival institution
    An archival institution is "An organization which keeps and preserves
    archival material and makes it accessible to the public" (ISDIAH
    glossary). In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to
    describe such institutions are based on the ICA's *International Standard
    for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings* (ISDIAH). See
    :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and :ref:`Archival
    institutions <archival-institutions>`.

  Archival unit
    Archival unit is a generic term for an aggregation of archival
    materials. A unit can be a :term:`fonds`, series, file, item, or
    variation thereof, depending on institutional standards. A unit may be
    divided into sub-units for the purposes of description: e.g. a
    :term:`fonds` may contain several series, each of which may contain
    several files, and so forth. The smallest (and therefore indivisible)
    unit is the item. See also
    :term:`level of description`.

  Arrangement
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines arrangement as "the intellectual and physical processes and
    results of analyzing and organizing documents in accordance with
    archival principles" (ISAD glossary).

  Authority record
    In AtoM, authority records are collections of information about actors
    - corporate bodies, persons, or families - who interact with archival
    materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. The :term:`data
    elements <data element>` used to describe authority records are based
    on the ICA's *International Standard Archival Authority Record for
    Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (ISAAR). ISAAR defines
    authority record as "The authorized form of name combined with other
    information elements that identify and describe the named entity and
    may also point to other related authority records." See :doc:`Entity
    types <../overview/entity-types>` and :doc:`Authority records <../add-
    edit-content/authority-records>`.

  Breadcrumb trail
    A breadcrumb trail is a navigational element in a :term:`user interface`
    that provides contextual information about the current location of a user
    in an application or document. Breadcrumb trails provide links back to
    each previous page the user navigated through to get to the current page
    or — in hierarchical site structures — the parent pages of the current
    one.

    In AtoM a breadcrumb trail is displayed to add contextual information and
    to facilitate navigation in several places. On :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, the breadcrumb trail is located at
    the top of record's :term:`view page` when viewing a :term:`child
    decription <child record>` to provide information about where in the
    hierarchy the current description appears. When moving archival
    descriptions (see: :ref:`Move an archival description
    <move-different-level>`), A breadcrumb trail is used to indicate where in
    a hierarchy the Move browse results are currently showing. At the top of
    :term:`archival institution` and :term:`authority record` view pages, the
    breadcrumb trail is used to provide a link back to the Browse page for
    each kind of record. Additionally, :term:`taxonomy` :term:`terms <term>`
    (such as :term:`places <place>` and :term:`subjects <subject>`) that are
    organized hierarchically will also display parent terms as a breadcrumb
    trail when added to an :term:`archival description` - for example, if the
    subject term 'Apple' is a child of the term 'Fruit', then when 'Apple' is
    added as a subject :term:`access point` to an
    :term:`archival description`, it will be expressed as: **Fruit >> Apple**

    In AtoM, breadcrumbs (i.e. individual components of a breadcrumb trail)
    are expressed as hyperlinks, and can be clicked to navigate to the related
    source or parent record.

  Browse menu
    Browsing allows a user to see all records that have a certain type of
    :term:`access point` (such as :term:`subject`, :term:`name`, or
    :term:`place`) or other type of filter, such as :term:`media type` or
    type of :term:`entity`. In AtoM's default theme (the Dominion theme)
    the browse menu appears in a drop-down next to the :term:`search box`
    in the :term:`header bar` on all pages, as well as on the :term:`home
    page`.

  Button block
    The button block allows authorized users to add, edit, delete, move,
    and duplicate content and to save or cancel changes made in the
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

  Carousel
    The carousel shows sets of :term:`thumbnails <thumbnail>` of
    :term:`digital objects <digital object>` and allows the user to scroll
    through the thumbnails using a mouse or keyboard scroll arrows. It is
    similar to the `cover flow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_flow>`_
    used in "the Macintosh Finder and other Apple Inc. products for
    visually flipping through snapshots of documents, website bookmarks,
    album artwork, or photographs. In AtoM a carousel viewer appears at
    the top of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`
    whenever there are associated lower-level descriptions that have
    digital objects attached.

  Child record
    Child record refers to a description of the :term:`archival unit` that
    is one :term:`level of description` lower than the current unit, e.g.
    if a series belongs to a :term:`fonds`, the series is the child record
    of the fonds. See also: :term:`Parent record <parent record>`.

  Collection
    In ISAD, a collection is "[a]n artificial assemblage of documents
    accumulated on the basis of some common characteristic without regard
    to the provenance of those documents. Not to be confused with an
    archival fonds." In the Canadian Rules for Archival Description, it is
    "[a] grouping of documents of any provenance intentionally assembled
    on the basis of some common characteristic." In Dublin Core, a
    collection is "[a]n aggregation of resources. A collection is
    described as a group; its parts may also be separately described."

  Column header
    Column headers appear at the top of the lists on list pages and browse
    results and give the name of the :term:`field` for whatever is being
    listed below.

  Context menu
    The context menu appears on all :term:`view <view page>` and some
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>` to provide greater contextual information
    about the record currently being viewed. On :term:`archival description`
    :term:`view pages <view page>`, this includes the name and/or logo of the
    :term:`archival institution` or :term:`repository` who holds the
    :term:`archival unit` the current record describes (which links to the
    repository's :term:`authority record`) and the :term:`treeview`, which
    shows the current record's relationships to other records, with links, on
    the left-hand side of the screen. The right-hand side of the screen
    includes related people (i.e., :term:`authority records
    <authority record>`), :term:`subjects <subject>`, and :term:`places
    <place>`, as well as available formats for export. When viewing an ISAAR-
    CPF :term:`authority record` for a person, family, or :term:`corporate
    body`, the left-hand side of the screen will show any relationships with
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` or other authority
    records. When viewing an ISDIAH :term:`authority record` for an
    :term:`archival institution`, the context menu displays a list of
    holdings on the left-hand side, with contact information for the
    :term:`repository` provided on the right-hand side of the record. See
    :doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>`.

  Contributor
    A contributor is a type of user who can search, browse, create, and
    edit descriptions. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

  Controlled vocabulary
    A controlled vocabulary is a set of pre-defined, authorized
    :term:`terms <term>` grouped into :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` or
    entered into :term:`authority records <authority record>` and used for
    generating :term:`value lists <value list>` and :term:`access points
    <access point>`. See :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>`.

  Corporate body
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a corporate body as "An organization or group of persons that
    is identified by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an
    entity" (ISAD glossary).

    Similarly, in the Canadian Rules for Archival Description (RAD), a
    corporate body is defined as "an organization or association of
    persons that is identified by a particular name and that acts, or may
    act, as an entity. Typical examples of corporate bodies are societies,
    institutions, business firms, nonprofit enterprises, governments,
    government agencies, religious bodies, places of worship, and
    conferences."

  Create button
    The create button, located on the :term:`button block`, is used to
    save new :term:`entities <entity>`. Once an entity has been saved for
    the first time, the create button disappears and is replaced by the
    "Save" button, which is used to save all subsequent changes.

  Creator
    A creator is "any entity (:term:`corporate body`, family or person)
    that created, accumulated and/or maintained records in the conduct of
    personal or corporate activity" (ISAAR glossary). In AtoM, the creator
    is described in an :term:`authority record` linked to an
    :term:`archival description`, usually at the highest :term:`level of
    description` only. Lower levels inherit the creator from the
    :term:`parent record`, unless a different creator is specified. AtoM
    can accommodate multiple creators at all levels of description. See
    :ref:`Context area <context-area>`

  Current language
    Refers to the language in which the :term:`user interface` elements
    and :term:`database content` are displayed. Users can switch between
    languages by using the :term:`language menu`.

  Data element
    Data elements, or elements of description, are `ICA
    <http://www.ica.org>`__ standards-based units of information applied
    to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, and :term:`terms <term>`. The
    elements are entered into fields in AtoM's
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

  Database content
    Database content refers to information stored in Atom's database
    tables, including :term:`data elements <data element>`, :term:`static
    page` content, and :term:`user profile` information.

  Deaccession record
    The deaccession record is used to indicate that a repository has
    removed an accession, in part or whole, from the collection. Instead
    of deleting an :term:`accession record`, the repository will create a
    deaccession record that is kept. See: :ref:`Deaccession records
    <deaccession-records>`.

  Default content
    Default content is any :term:`database content` that is included by
    default when AtoM is installed. This includes things like the default
    :term:`home page` and :term:`drop-down menu` values that are stored in
    :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.

  Default language
    The default language is the language in which all :term:`user
    interface` elements are displayed when AtoM is opened. The language is
    specified when the application is installed. Users can switch to other
    :term:`supported languages <supported language>` and
    :term:`translators <translator>` can translate :term:`database
    content` and :term:`user interface` elements. See :doc:`Choose
    language <../getting-started/choose-language>` and :ref:`Translate
    <translate>`.

  Delete button
    The delete button appears in the :term:`button block`. Clicking on the
    delete button will prompt a warning to appear asking whether the user
    really intends to delete the :term:`entity`.

  Delete icon
    Delete icons are small buttons in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` used
    to delete values from :term:`multi-value fields <multi-value field>`,
    such as those containing :term:`event` dates or :term:`access points
    <access point>`.

  Developer
    A developer is a `programmer
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer>`_ who is able to modify the
    underlying software code of an AtoM application.

  Digital object
    Digital objects are computer files that can be uploaded into and
    displayed by AtoM. They include scanned images, digital photographs,
    sound and moving image files, and other scanned or born-digital items.
    See :doc:`Upload digital objects <../import-export/upload-digital-
    object>` and :ref:`File formats <file-formats>`.

  Display standard
    The display standard indicates which archival description standard is
    used to display and edit the :term:`archival unit`. The default
    display standard for the application can be set by an
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` in the Default template area of
    the Settings menu. See :doc:`Settings <../administer/settings>`.

    AtoM also allows an authenticated user with the appropriate
    permissions to set which :term:`archival description` standards
    template is used to display the current description, and if desired,
    all of its related :term:`child records <child record>`. Users can
    select from multiple standards-based templates supported in AtoM.
    Using this feature, located in the :term:`Administration area
    <administration area>` of an :term:`archival description`'s
    :term:`edit page`, users can choose if archival descriptions held by
    the same :term:`archival institution` are displayed to end-users with
    different archival standards templates, or even if different
    :term:`levels of description <level of description>` in the same
    :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection` are displayed with different
    standards templates. See :doc:`Entity types
    <../overview/entity-types>`, :doc:`Descriptive standards
    <../overview/descriptive-standards>`, and :doc:`Archival descriptions
    <../add-edit-content/archival-descriptions>`.

  Document
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org>`__),
    in the ISAD glossary, defines a document as "recorded information
    regardless of medium or characteristics. (See also
    :term:`Record <record>`)".

  Dominion theme
     The Dominion theme is the default theme that ships with AtoM 2.0. It has
     been built using `Twitter Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`__ 2.3,
     with some added `JavaScript
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript>`__ elements, and features a
     black :term:`header bar` and a light grey application background color.
     AtoM has been designed so that other themes can be added to the
     application as plugins, after which an :term:`administrator` can change
     the application theme via the :term:`user interface` by navigating to
     **Admin > Themes**. See :ref:`Themes and theming <themes-theming>`

  Donor dialog
    The dialog that opens when adding donor contact information to the
    :term:`accession record` or when selecting to edit an existing donor
    record. Donor records are located under the "Manage" tab in the menu.
    Donor records are only available to logged-in users with permissions.
    See: :doc:`Donors <../add-edit-content/donors>`.

  Draft record
    A draft record is an :term:`archival description` that has not been
    published. All new and imported :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>` have draft status until the user changes that status to
    published in the :term:`Administration area <administration area>` the
    bottom of the archival description :term:`edit page`. The
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can change the default
    publication status from draft to published in the **Admin > Settings >
    Global > Default publication status**.

    The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level of
    description`. Users who are not authenticated cannot view draft
    records. See also :term:`Published record <published record>`. See:
    :ref:`Publish an archival description <publish-archival-description>`.

  Drop-down menu
    A drop-down list menu is a list of data-entry options that appears
    below certain :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`edit pages <edit
    page>`. Values are drawn from :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>`, :term:`authority records <authority
    record>`, and default data contained in AtoM's database tables.

  Duplicate button
    The duplicate button appears at the bottom of the :term:`view page`;
    clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit duplicate`; this
    page is an :term:`edit page` that is pre-populated with the existing
    data from the original record. The user can edit the duplicate record
    page and then save it as a new record. Some users use the duplicate
    function in toM like a record skeleton when doing large amounts of
    data-entry on similar records.

  Edit button
    The edit button appears at the bottom of :term:`view pages <view
    page>`; clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit page`
    for that :term:`record`.

    The user can also switch between view and edit pages by clicking the
    :term:`title bar` of an :term:`information area`.

  Edit duplicate
    After the user clicks the :term:`duplicate button` the :term:`edit
    page` provides a warning. The user is now editing a duplicate record
    (automatically draft status). After editing the duplicate record the
    user can click the cancel or save button at the bottom of the screen.

  Edit icon
    The edit icon appears in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` next to
    :term:`fields <field>` that derive data from a related record. The
    user clicks the icon to edit the text in the related record, e.g. to
    edit the "Administrative/biographical history" in an :term:`archival
    description`, the user must click the edit icon because the data
    resides in the :term:`creator's <creator>` :term:`authority record`.

  Edit mode
    Edit mode allows the user to add, modify, or delete the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and other database content using
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In edit mode, AtoM displays all
    :term:`fields <field>` in a :term:`record` for data entry.

  Editor
    An editor is a type of user who can search, browse, add, edit and
    delete :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`,
    and :term:`terms <term>`. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

  Edit page
    Edit pages allow users to add, edit and delete the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and
    :term:`accession records <accession record>`. They are also used to carry
    out administrative functions such as changing :term:`user profiles <user
    profile>` and editing   :term:`static pages <static page>`.

  Entity
    An entity is an object about which an information system collects
    data. From the user's perspective, in AtoM there are six main
    entities: :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
    :term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`,
    :term:`rights records <rights record>`, and <:term:`terms <term>`. See
    :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`.

  Error message
    An error message will display when AtoM is unable to execute an
    action. See :ref:`Error <page-type-error>` for examples of types of error
    messages.

  Event
    In AtoM, an event registers an action by an actor (:term:`corporate
    body`, person, or family) at a particular time or over a span of time
    and may establish a relationship between the actor and other actors or
    :term:`entities <entity>`. This is accomplished through the use of
    start and end dates in the context area of the :term:`archival
    description`, which links the :term:`creator` or other actor to the
    records for the period of time delimited by the dates. See
    :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and :ref:`Context area
    <context-area>`.

  Facet filter
    In information science, a facet is a clearly defined
    concept group, characteristic, or aspect of a class or specific subejct.
    Often made up of mutually exclusive categories drawn from the properties
    of a group of information elements, when applied as filters, facets allow a
    user to access and order query (search or browse) results in multiple
    ways, rather than in a single pre-determined order.

    In AtoM facet filters are available to users on search and browse pages
    as a means of grouping and narrowing results. They are drawn from
    available :term:`fields <field>` within the :term:`entity type` being
    browsed or searched. See :ref:`Browse <browse>`, :doc:`Search
    <../access-content/search>`, and :ref:`Navigate <navigate>`.

  Field
    A field is a container for a :term:`data element`. Content is added to
    or modified in fields in :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. For further
    information, see the Wikipedia entry for `Field
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28computer_science%29>`_.

  Field label
    Field labels identify :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`view pages
    <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In AtoM, the
    :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can select certain field labels
    and hide them from public (unauthorized Users) views. See
    :doc:`Visible elements <../administer/visible-elements>`.

  Finding aid
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a finding aid as "The broadest term to cover any description
    or means of reference made or received by an archives service in the
    course of establishing administrative or intellectual control over
    archival material" (ISAD Glossary)

    The finding aid is a tool for discovering information about the
    :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`. In AtoM, the entirety of an
    archival description (including all :term:`child records <child
    record>` and the :term:`parent record` can be understood as an online
    finding aid, used for discovery and access. The View archival
    description screen can also be printed and saved as a Finding Aid in
    `pdf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format>`_.

  Fonds
    Fonds is an :term:`archival unit` defined as "The whole of the
    records, regardless of form or medium, organically created and/or
    accumulated and used by a particular person, family, or
    :term:`corporate body` in the course of that :term:`creator's
    <creator>` activities and :term:`functions <function>`." (ISAD
    glossary).

    In AtoM, the fonds is by default the highest :term:`level
    of description`. This default can be changed by :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` (see :ref:`User interface labels
    <user-interface-labels>`).

  Function
    A function is a type of entity that describes activities linked to
    records creation, maintenance and use. The International Council on
    Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) defines a function as "Any
    high level purpose, responsibility or task assigned to the
    accountability agenda of a corporate body by legislation, policy or
    mandate. Functions may be decomposed into sets of co-ordinated
    operations such as subfunctions, business processes, activities, tasks
    or transactions" (ISDF Glossary).

    Functions in AtoM are linked to :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>` and other
    functions. In AtoM the :term:`fields <field>` for describing functions
    are taken from the ICA's International Standard for Describing
    Functions (ISDF). See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`
    and :doc:`Functions <../add-edit-content/functions>`.

  Global search/replace
    Global search and replace allows :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` to query the entire database and globally replace
    specific :term:`terms <term>` in each :term:`field`: title, alternate
    title, scope and content, bio/admin history etc. The Global search and
    replace menu can be found under the :term:`Admin menu <admin menu>`.
    See the Global search and replace menu for a full list of available
    fields.

  Header bar
    The header bar is the navigational tool at the top of all pages in
    AtoM. It includes the :term:`search box`, :term:`browse menu`, and
    :term:`site logo` for all users, and the
    :term:`main menu` for authenticated (i.e. logged in) users.

  Holdings
    Holdings is a generic term referring to the :term:`records <record>`
    and other materials held by :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>`. In AtoM a list of holdings is displayed in the
    :term:`context menu` on :term:`archival institution` :term:`view pages
    <view page>`. The list is generated from the titles of :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>` that have the :term:`archival
    institution` selected as a repository (see Context area).  See
    :doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>` and :ref:`Context
    area <context-area>`.

  Home page
    The home page is the first page the user sees when opening the AtoM
    application. It can also be accessed by clicking the site logo. The
    content of the home page can be edited by :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` (see :doc:`Manage static pages
    <..administer/manage-static-pages>`).

  Information area
    Information areas appear on :term:`edit pages <edit page>` and group
    related :term:`fields <field>` based on the organization of elements
    of description in `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__ (or other supported)
    descriptive standards. Clicking on an information area toggles it
    between closed (all fields in that area hidden) and open (all fields
    visible).

  Information object
    An information object is another term for an :term:`archival
    description` that can be more broadly applied to any description of a
    resource, not necessarily archival in origin.

  Language menu
    The language menu, located in the top-right corner of the page, allows
    the user to switch to any of the :term:`supported languages <supported
    language>` in AtoM. See :ref:`Choose language <choose-language>`; see also
    :doc:`Default language <../administer/default-language>` and
    :ref:`Add/remove languages <add-remove-languages>` .

  Level of description
    The level of description is "the position of the unit of description
    in the hierarchy of the :term:`fonds`" (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, the
    level of description is selected from a :term:`value list` in the
    "Identity" area of an :term:`archival description`. See :ref:`Identity
    area <identity-area>`.

  Main menu
    The main menu is the the navigational tool located at the top of all
    pages for authenticated  (logged in) users, as part of the
    :term:`header bar`. It allows the user to navigate to all the main
    areas of AtoM.

  Master digital object
    The master digital object is the unaltered version of a :term:`digital
    object` that has been uploaded to AtoM. AtoM automatically generates a
    :term:`thumbnail` and a :term:`reference display copy` of the object.
    Only authenticated users may view master digital objects. See
    :doc:`Upload digital objects
    <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.

  Media type
    Media type refers to the format of uploaded :term:`digital objects
    <digital object>`. The media type is selected automatically by AtoM
    when a :term:`digital object` is uploaded and the :term:`thumbnail`
    and :term:`reference display copies <reference display copy>` of the
    object are generated. See :doc:`Upload digital objects
    <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.

    .. NOTE::

       Media type terms are controlled by the media type :term:`taxonomy`.
       AtoM ships with five :term:`terms <term>` (audio, image, text,
       video, other) that are locked; these cannot be edited or deleted
       because they are referenced by AtoM's code. :term:`Editors
       <editor>` and :term:`administrators <administrator>` can add new
       :term:`media type` terms, but unless :term:`developers <developer>`
       incorporate these into the code, the system will not be able to do
       anything with them.

  Multi-repository system
    A multi-repository system exists when a single instance of AtoM is
    used by a :term:`network` of :term:`archival institutions <archival
    institution>` or other types of repositories.

  Multi-value field
    A multi-value field is a :term:`field` that is structured to contain
    more than one data entry.

  Name
    In AtoM, names are registered in :term:`authority records <authority
    record>` for :term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`, persons, and
    families who interact with archival materials as e.g. :term:`creators
    <creator>`, custodians and publishers. Names can be applied as
    :term:`access points <access point>` to :term:`archival descriptions
    <archival description>`. See :ref:`Access points <access-points>`.

  Network
    A network is an aggregation of institutions using one instance of AtoM
    to produce a union list of archival holdings (a
    :term:`multi-repository system`).

  Parent record
    The parent record refers to the description of the :term:`archival
    unit` that is one :term:`level of description` higher than the current
    unit. For example, a :term:`fonds` may be the parent record of a
    series. A parent record may have multiple :term:`child records
    <child record>`.

  Password
    A password is a case-sensitive, unspaced string of characters (alpha-
    numeric and/or special characters) associated with a :term:`user
    account` and intended to be kept private, to provide a user with a
    secure means of logging into the AtoM application. Passwords are
    required by every user of the system who needs to be able to add,
    edit, delete, or translate content. The initial passwords are set by
    the system :term:`administrator` (see :doc:`Manage user accounts
    <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`) and can subsequently be changed
    by the user (see :ref:`Change password <change-password>`).

  Physical storage
    Physical storage is a grouping of :term:`fields <field>` relating to
    the management of physical objects such as folders, boxes, shelves,
    and cabinets. In AtoM, users can create and edit information about
    physical objects by clicking on the "Link physical storage" button in
    the :term:`button block` of an :term:`archival description`. See
    :doc:`Physical storage <../add-edit-content/physical-storage>`.

  Place
    In AtoM, a place is a geographic location registered in a
    :term:`taxonomy` and used as an :term:`access point` in
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, and :term:`archival institutions
    <archival institution>`.

  Print icon
    An icon of a printer is located in the :term:`title bar` of the View
    Physical storage and Search/Advanced Search results screen. Clicking
    the icon will allow the user to print out a report - the page display
    will be rendered in a simple black and white for easier printing. See
    :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.

  Publication status
    The publication status of a record, which can be set to either :term:`draft
    <draft record>` or :term:`published <published record>`, determines whether
    or not the associated description is visible to unauthenticated (i.e., not
    logged in) users, such as :term:`researchers <researcher>`. It can be
    changed in the :term:`administration area` of a description's :term:`edit
    page` by a user with edit permissions. See :ref:`Publish an archival
    description <publish-archival-description>`


  Published record
    A published record is an :term:`archival description` that has had its
    status changed from draft to published in the :term:`Administration
    area <administration area>` at the bottom of the :term:`archival
    description` :term:`edit page`.

    .. NOTE::

       The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level
       of description`; e.g. when a :term:`fonds` description is changed
       from draft to published, all :term:`child records <child record>`
       within the fonds are automatically changed as well. Once archival
       descriptions have been published, users who are not logged in can
       view them. See :ref:`Publish an archival description
       <publish-archival-description>`

  Radio button
    A radio button is an element of a :term:`user interface` that allows a
    user to select only one of a predefined list of options. Radio buttons
    are used throughout the AtoM application, including in the **Admin >
    Themes** page to select a theme, and in the **Admin > Settings** page to
    control a number of different options.

  Record
    The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__)
    defines a record as "recorded information in any form or medium,
    created or received and maintained, by an organization or person in
    the transaction of business or the conduct of affairs" (ISAD
    glossary).

    The Society of American Archivists (`SAA
    <http://www2.archivists.org/>`_), which maintains an excellent
    glossary of `archival terminology
    <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`_, holds several different
    definitions of a record, including: "data or information in a fixed
    form that is created or received in the course of individual or
    institutional activity and set aside (preserved) as evidence of that
    activity for future reference."

    In AtoM, an :term:`archival description` is used to provide contextual
    information about and intellectual control over archival materials,
    which include records.

  Reference display copy
    A reference display copy is a low-resolution version of a
    :term:`master digital object` generated automatically by AtoM on
    upload. It is used to display images on the :term:`digital object`
    :term:`view page` when the user clicks on a :term:`thumbnail`, on
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` that have linked
    digital objects, and in the digital object area of :term:`edit pages
    <edit page>`. See See :doc:`Upload digital objects
    <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.

  Report icon
    In AtoM a report icon can be found in the right hand :term:`context
    menu` of an :term:`archival description` :term:`view page`. Clicking
    on the report icon takes the user to a Reports screen and the choice
    of printing 3 different reports: File list, Item list, :term:`Physical
    storage <physical storage>` locations, or a set of Box labels,
    formatted as a `CSV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-
    separated_values>`_. See :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.

  Repository
    The Society of American Archivists `Glossary
    <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`__ defines a repository as "any
    type of organization that holds documents, including business,
    institutional, and government archives, manuscript collections,
    libraries, museums, and historical societies, and in any form,
    including manuscripts, photographs, moving image and sound materials,
    and their electronic equivalents."

    In AtoM, the term is sometimes used as a more generic term for
    :term:`archival institution` that includes all cultural heritage
    organizations.


  Researcher
    A researcher is a type of user who is limited to searching and
    browsing descriptions. See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`.

  Rights record
    In AtoM, Rights records can be linked to :term:`accession records
    <accession record>`, :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>` and :term:`digital objects <digital object>`. AtoM
    Rights metadata elements use `PREMIS rights elements
    <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`_. In AtoM restrictions can be
    based on Copyright(s), License, Statute(s) and Policy. For a full
    explanation see :doc:`Rights <../add-edit-content/rights>`.

  Search box
    The search box is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text
    matching a search query. The search box is located in the
    :term:`header bar` on all AtoM pages, including the home page. See
    :ref:`Access content <access-content>`.

  Setting
    Settings is a broad term used to describe the properties that affect
    the way a program looks and functions. In AtoM, certain settings can
    be changed by an :term:`administrator` in order to customize AtoM to
    institution-specific requirements. See :doc:`Settings
    <../administer/settings>`.

  Site description
    The site description is a brief description of the site's purpose or
    its contents, that can be optionally included by an
    :term:`administrator` when configuring the :term:`settings <setting>`
    of an AtoM installation. When made visible via AtoM's :doc:`Settings
    <../administer/settings>`, the site title appears at the top of the
    page directly under the :term:`header bar`. It is a configurable
    element - the text can be changed or removed. See
    :ref:`Site information <site-information>` and :ref:`Default page
    elements <default-page-elements>`.

  Site logo
    The site logo is the graphic that appears at the top of all pages in
    the left-hand cornder of the :term:`header bar` in AtoM. Clicking on
    the logo will take the user to the :term:`home page`. AtoM ships with
    a default logo that can be replaced by
    :term:`administrators <administrator>` to theme the application to
    their own institution or :term:`network` if desired: see Site logo.

  Site title
    The site title is a configurable element in AtoM that can be managed
    by an :term:`administrator` through the application :term:`settings
    <setting>`. In AtoM 2.0, the site title does not appear in the
    application itself, but will be present in the title bar of a user's
    web browser when accessing AtoM. See :ref:`Site information
    <site-information>`.

  SKOS
    Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a data standard model
    developed by the `World Wide Web Consortium <http://www.w3.org/>`_
    (W3C) as a common data model "for expressing the basic structure and
    content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes,
    subject heading lists, taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similar
    types of controlled vocabulary." (`W3C SKOS Primer, 18 August 2009
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-skos-primer-20090818/>`_). It is used
    in AtoM to import and export hierarchical :term:`taxonomies
    <taxonomy>`. See: :doc:`Export descriptions and terms
    <../import-export/export-descriptions-and-terms>`.

  Static page
    Static pages are pages that are designed to look the same each time
    they are accessed, in contrast to dynamic pages such as :ref:`search
    results <search-results>`, :term:`view pages <view page>`, or
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. AtoM has two static pages, the
    :term:`home page` and the :term:`about page`. Static pages can be
    edited by an :term:`administrator` (see :doc:`Manage static pages
    <../administer/manage-static-pages>`).

  Subject
    In AtoM, subjects are :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>` grouped in a :term:`taxonomy` and
    used as :term:`access points <access point>` in :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`.

  Supported language
    In AtoM, a supported language is one into which both :term:`data
    elements <data element>` and :term:`user interface` elements can be
    translated.

  Taxonomy
    A taxonomy is a grouping of :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled
    vocabulary>` :term:`terms <term>` used to generate :term:`value lists
    <value list>` and :term:`access points <access point>`. See
    :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>`.

  Term
    Terms are the values that make up :term:`controlled vocabularies
    <controlled vocabulary>`. In AtoM, terms are grouped into
    :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` that can be added, edited, and deleted
    through the "Term" item of the add menu. See
    :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>`.

  Thumbnail
    A thumbnail is a small, low-resolution version of a :term:`master
    digital object` generated automatically by AtoM on upload. Thumbnails
    are displayed in search and browse results and in :term:`carousel`
    views at higher levels of description. See :doc:`Upload digital objects
    <../import-export/upload-digital-object>` and :ref:`File formats
    <file-formats>`.

  Title bar
    The title that appears at the top of :term:`information areas
    <information area>` in :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`,
    :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` and :term:`functions
    <function>`. When an authenticated (i.e., logged in) user with edit
    privileges clicks on the title bar of an :term:`information area` when in
    :term:`view mode`, the page reloads in :term:`edit mode` so the user can
    edit content.

  Tooltips
    Tooltips are online text designed to assist users to enter data in
    :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. Tooltip text is usually derived from
    the standards on which the edit templates are based; in rare occasions
    where the :term:`field` does not correspond directly to a standard,
    this text has been supplied. Note that :term:`administrators
    <administrator>` can turn tooltips on or off. See :ref:`Global settings
    <global-settings>`.

  Translation bar
    The translation bar appears at the bottom of the page when users with
    :term:`translator` :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` select
    a language from the :term:`language menu`. Clicking on "Translate user
    interface" in the bottom right-hand corner of the bar opens up the
    :term:`translation panel`, where the user translates :term:`user
    interface` elements. See :ref:`Translate <translate>`.

  Translation panel
    The translation panel is used by :term:`translators <translator>` to
    edit :term:`user interface` elements and is accessed via the
    :term:`translation bar`. See :ref:`Translate interface <translate-interface>`.

  Translator
    A translator is a type of user who can translate :term:`data elements
    <data element>` and :term:`user interface` elements. See :ref:`User roles
    <user-roles>`

  Treeview
    The treeview is a contextual and navigation element located in the
    :term:`context menu` for :term:`archival descriptions <archival
    description>`, :term:`places <place>`, and :term:`subjects <subject>`. It
    shows the current record's relationships to other records, with links,
    e.g. the hierarchical placement of :term:`archival descriptions
    <archival description>` within a :term:`fonds`, or the hierarchical
    placement of a :term:`term` (such as a :term:`subject` or :term:`place`)
    within a :term:`taxonomy`. The treeview can also be used for navigation.
    See: :ref:`Context menu <context-menu>`.

  Typeahead
    Typeahead (also known as incremental search or real-time suggestions) is a
    form of auto-complete used in a :term:`user interface`. As a user enters
    text, one or more possible matches are found and presented to the user,
    which continue to narrow as a user enters further text.
    This allows a user to dynamically view results and select a
    resource without necessarily having to enter its full name or title. In
    AtoM, the :term:`search box` implements typeahead, and presents the user
    with results divided into :term:`entity types <entity type>` such as
    :term:`archival description`, :term:`authority record`, :term:`archival
    institution`, :term:`subject`, and :term:`place:`. It appears as a
    :term:`drop-down <drop-down>` below the :term:`search box` as a user
    enters text. See: :doc:`Search <../access-content/search>` and :ref:`The
    search box <search-box>`.

  User account
    User accounts are established in order to manage :term:`access
    privileges <access privilege>` through the assignment of :term:`user
    roles <user role>`. Every user who must be able to add, edit, delete,
    or translate content must have a user account. In AtoM user accounts
    are established and maintained by :term:`administrators <administrator>`.
    See :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` and  :doc:`Manage user accounts
    <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`.

  User interface
    The user interface is the set of elements that allow the user to
    interact with the AtoM application. These elements include the :
    :term:`main menu`, :term:`drop-down menus <drop-down menu>`,
    :term:`context menu`, :term:`title bar`, :term:`column headers <column
    header>`, buttons and :term:`button block`, :term:`fields <field>`, and
    :term:`field labels <field label>`, and any other elements used to
    navigate AtoM or to search for, view, add, edit, and delete
    :term:`database content`. The labels of some user interface elements
    can be customized by :term:`administrators <administrator>` (see
    :ref:`User interface labels <user-interface-labels>`).

  Username
    The username is a name supplied by an :term:`administrator` to any
    user (other than a :term:`researcher`) of the AtoM application as part
    of the :term:`user account`. See :doc:`Manage user accounts
    <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`.

  User profile
    A user profile is information about a user managed in a :term:`user
    account`. User profiles are created and maintained by
    :term:`administrators  <administrator>` (see :doc:`Manage user accounts
    <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`), although authenticated (i.e.,
    logged in) users can view their own profiles (and change their
    :term:`passwords <password>`) by going through the :term:`header bar`
    (see: :ref:`Change password <change-password>`).

  User role
    User roles define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from
    view-only access to full administration rights. User roles are defined
    by groups that an :term:`administrator` can add and edit. See
    :ref:`User roles <user-roles>` and  :doc:`Manageuser accounts
    <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`.

  Value list
    Value lists restrict data entry in certain :term:`fields <field>` to
    :term:`controlled vocabulary` :term:`terms <term>` or terms derived
    from :term:`authority records <authority record>`. They appear as
    :term:`drop-down menus <drop-down menu>` in :term:`edit pages
    <edit page>`.

  View mode
    View mode provides read-only access to the contents of :term:`archival
    descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records
    <authority record>`, :term:`functions <function>` and :term:`archival
    institutions <archival institution>` using :term:`view pages <view
    page>`. In view mode, AtoM displays only those :term:`fields <field>`
    in a :term:`record` which contain data.

  View page
    View pages allow users to view in detail the contents of
    :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
    records <authority record>`, :term:`functions <function>` and
    :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`.

  Visible elements
    Visible elements enables an :term:`administrator` to "hide" specific
    :term:`fields <field>` in the database from the public (i.e.,
    unauthorized users, or users who are not logged in). To review which
    fields can be hidden from view, select ISAD template, RAD template,
    Digital object metadata area, and/or Physical Storage. The
    :term:`administrator` can click on the checkboxes to reveal the field,
    while an unchecked box hides the field. See :doc:`Visible elements
    <../administer/visible-elements>`.
