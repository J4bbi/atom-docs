AtoM User Manual Glossary of Terms
==================================

.. glossary::

	About page
		The about page provides general information on AtoM. It can be reached via the :term:`user menu` in
		the top right-hand corner of the page. The content of the about page can be edited by 
		:term:`administrators <administrator>` (see :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`).

	Accession record
		The accession record is an administrative and descriptive document that summarizes standard
		information about the process of transferring materials to a repository, including
		information about the provenance, contents and legal and physical transfer of the records
		such as, rights and restrictions. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`

	Access point
		An access point is "A name, term, keyword, phrase or code that may be used to search,
		identify and locate an archival description." (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, access points
		are derived from :term:`authority records <authority record>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` 
		created and customized by users. See :doc:`Terms </add-edit-content/terms>`.

	Access privilege
		Access privileges control the ways a user is able to interact with AtoM. For example,
		some users are able to add and edit content while others may only be able to search and
		browse content. Access privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles <user role>` (see :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`).

	Accrual
		An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description already held by a 
		repository." (ISAD glossary)

	Add menu
		The "Add" menu allows authorized users to add new :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, 
		:term:`terms <term>`, and :term:`functions <function>`. Only logged-in users can see the "Add" menu.

	Add new button
		The add new button is located in the :term:`button block <button block>` of the :term:`view page <view page>`
		and allows users to add new records (:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, and
		:term:`terms <term>`) to AtoM.

	Admin menu
		The admin menu allows users with :term:`administrator <administrator>` access to customize AtoM to meet 
		institution-specific requirements and to manage :term:`user accounts <user account> and 
		:term:`user profiles <user profile>`. The admin menu is only visible to users with administrator privileges.
		See :ref:`Administer <administer>`.

	Administration area
		The Administration area is part of the resource description edit template. It allows the User to
		change the publication status of the resource - Draft (this resource description is not available for
		public viewing) and Published (this resource description is available for public viewing).

	Administrator
		The administrator is a type of user who has :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to do the 
		following: install or uninstall ICA-AtoM; create, read, update, or delete any record; customize AtoM 
		to institution-specific requirements or themes; and manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and
		:term:`user profiles <user profile>` (see :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>` and
		:ref:`Administer <administer>`).
		
	Advanced search
		The advanced search is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text matching a search query.
		The advanced search hyperlink can be accessed in the drop-down that appears when a user places the cursor
		in the :term:`search box`. In the advanced search page, the user can select "and, or, not" operators, and search
		specific fields, to create a powerful search query. The option to apply filters to limit or narrow the search
		are also provided.
	
	Archival description
		An archival description is a body of information about an archival record or records. The descriptions
		provide contextual information about the archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical levels (fonds, 
		series, files, items, and variations of these in accordance with institutional standards).

		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines an archival description as 
		"The creation of an accurate representation of a unit of description and its component parts, if any, by 
		capturing, analyzing, organizing and recording information that serves to identify, manage, locate and 
		explain archival materials and the context and records systems which produced it. This term also describes 
		the products of the process" (ISAD glossary).

		In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used for describing archival records are derived from the ICA's *General International 
		Standard Archival Description* (ISAD). See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and 
		:doc:`Archival descriptions <../add-edit-content/archival-descriptions>`.
		
	Archival institution
		An archival institution is "An organization which keeps and preserves archival material and makes it 
		accessible to the public" (ISDIAH glossary). In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to 
		describe such institutions are based on the ICA's *International Standard for Describing Institutions with 
		Archival Holdings* (ISDIAH). See entity types and Add/edit archival institutions.
	
	Archival unit
		Archival unit is a generic term for an aggregation of archival materials. A unit can be a :term:`fonds`, series, 
		file, item, or variation thereof, depending on institutional standards. A unit may be divided into 
		sub-units for the purposes of description: e.g. a :term:`fonds` may contain several series, each of which 
		may contain several files, and so forth. The smallest (and therefore indivisible) unit is the item. See also 
		:term:`level of description`.
		
	Arrangmement
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines arrangement as "the intellectual and 
		physical processes and results of analyzing and organizing documents in accordance with archival principles" (ISAD glossary).
		
	Authority record
		In AtoM, authority records are collections of information about actors - corporate bodies, persons, or families - who interact 
		with archival materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. The :term:`data elements <data element>` used to describe authority records are based on the ICA's 
		*International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (ISAAR). ISAAR defines authority record as 
		"The authorized form of name combined with other information elements that identify and describe the named entity and may also point 
		to other related authority records." See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and 
		:doc:`Authority records <../add-edit-content/authority-records>`.
	
	Browse menu
		Browsing allows a user to see all records that have a certain type of :term:`access point` (such as :term:`subject`, :term:`name`, or 
		:term:`place) or other type of filter, such as :term:`media type` or type of :term:`entity`. In AtoM's default theme (the Dominion theme) 
		the browse menu appears in a drop-down next to the :term:`search box`, as well as on the :term:`home page`.
	
	Button block
		The button block allows authorized users to add, edit, delete, move, and duplicate content and to save or cancel changes made 
		in the :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

	Carousel
		The carousel shows sets of :term:`thumbnails <thumbnail>` of :term:`digital objects <digital object>` and allows the user to scroll through the thumbnails using a mouse or keyboard scroll arrows. It 
		is similar to the `cover flow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_flow>`_ used in "the Macintosh Finder and other Apple the Macintosh Finder and other Apple Inc. 
		products for visually flipping through snapshots of documents, website bookmarks, album artwork, or photographs. In AtoM a carousel viewer appears at the top of 
		:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` whenever there are associated lower-level descriptions that have digital objects attached.
	
	Child record
		Child record refers to a description of the :term:`archival unit` that is one :term:`level of description` lower than the current unit, 
		e.g. if a series belongs to a :term:`fonds`, the series is the child record of the fonds. See also: :term:`Parent record <parent record>`.
	
	Collection
		In ISAD, a collection is "[a]n artificial assemblage of documents accumulated on the basis of some common characteristic without regard to 
		the provenance of those documents. Not to be confused with an archival fonds." In the Canadian Rules for Archival Description, it is 
		"[a] grouping of documents of any provenance intentionally assembled on the basis of some common characteristic." In Dublin Core, a collection 
		is "[a]n aggregation of resources. A collection is described as a group; its parts may also be separately described."
	
	Context menu
		The context menu appears on all :term:`view <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>` to show the current record's relationships to other records, 
		with links, e.g. they show the hierarchical placement of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` within a :term:`fonds` and the relationship 
		between :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, and archival holdings. See 
		:doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>`. 
	
	Contributor
		A contributor is a type of user who can search, browse, create, and edit descriptions. See :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`.
	
	Controlled vocabulary
		A controlled vocabulary is a set of pre-defined, authorized :term:`terms <term>` grouped into :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` or entered into 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>` and used for generating :term:`value lists <value list>` and :term:`access points <access point>`. 
		See :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>`.
	
	Corporate body
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines a corporate body as "An organization or group of persons that is identified 
		by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an entity" (ISAD glossary).

		Similarly, in the Canadian Rules for Archival Description (RAD), a corporate body is defined as "an organization or association of persons that is identified 
		by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an entity. Typical examples of corporate bodies are societies, institutions, business firms, nonprofit 
		enterprises, governments, government agencies, religious bodies, places of worship, and conferences."
