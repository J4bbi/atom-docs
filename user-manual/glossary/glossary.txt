==================================
AtoM User Manual Glossary of Terms
==================================

.. glossary::

	About page
		The about page provides general information on AtoM. It can be reached via the :term:`user menu` in
		the top right-hand corner of the page. The content of the about page can be edited by 
		:term:`administrators <administrator>` (see :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`).

	Accession record
		The accession record is an administrative and descriptive document that summarizes standard
		information about the process of transferring materials to a repository, including
		information about the provenance, contents and legal and physical transfer of the records
		such as, rights and restrictions. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`

	Access point
		An access point is "A name, term, keyword, phrase or code that may be used to search,
		identify and locate an archival description." (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, access points
		are derived from :term:`authority records <authority record>` and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` 
		created and customized by users. See :doc:`Terms </add-edit-content/terms>`.

	Access privilege
		Access privileges control the ways a user is able to interact with AtoM. For example,
		some users are able to add and edit content while others may only be able to search and
		browse content. Access privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles <user role>` (see :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`).

	Accrual
		An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description already held by a 
		repository." (ISAD glossary)

	Add menu
		The "Add" menu allows authorized users to add new :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, 
		:term:`terms <term>`, and :term:`functions <function>`. Only logged-in users can see the "Add" menu.

	Add new button
		The add new button is located in the :term:`button block <button block>` of the :term:`view page <view page>`
		and allows users to add new records (:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, and
		:term:`terms <term>`) to AtoM.

	Admin menu
		The admin menu allows users with :term:`administrator <administrator>` access to customize AtoM to meet 
		institution-specific requirements and to manage :term:`user accounts <user account> and 
		:term:`user profiles <user profile>`. The admin menu is only visible to users with administrator privileges.
		See :ref:`Administer <administer>`.

	Administration area
		The Administration area is part of the resource description edit template. It allows the User to
		change the publication status of the resource - Draft (this resource description is not available for
		public viewing) and Published (this resource description is available for public viewing). It also allows the user
		to set a default :term:`display standard` for an :term:`archival description`. 

	Administrator
		The administrator is a type of user who has :term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to do the 
		following: install or uninstall ICA-AtoM; create, read, update, or delete any record; customize AtoM 
		to institution-specific requirements or themes; and manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and
		:term:`user profiles <user profile>` (see :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>` and
		:ref:`Administer <administer>`).
		
	Advanced search
		The advanced search is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text matching a search query.
		The advanced search hyperlink can be accessed in the drop-down that appears when a user places the cursor
		in the :term:`search box`. In the advanced search page, the user can select "and, or, not" operators, and search
		specific fields, to create a powerful search query. The option to apply filters to limit or narrow the search
		are also provided.
	
	Archival description
		An archival description is a body of information about an archival record or records. The descriptions
		provide contextual information about the archival materials and are arranged into hierarchical levels (fonds, 
		series, files, items, and variations of these in accordance with institutional standards).

		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines an archival description as 
		"The creation of an accurate representation of a unit of description and its component parts, if any, by 
		capturing, analyzing, organizing and recording information that serves to identify, manage, locate and 
		explain archival materials and the context and records systems which produced it. This term also describes 
		the products of the process" (ISAD glossary).

		In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used for describing archival records are derived from the ICA's *General International 
		Standard Archival Description* (ISAD). See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and 
		:doc:`Archival descriptions <../add-edit-content/archival-descriptions>`.
		
	Archival institution
		An archival institution is "An organization which keeps and preserves archival material and makes it 
		accessible to the public" (ISDIAH glossary). In AtoM the :term:`data elements <data element>` used to 
		describe such institutions are based on the ICA's *International Standard for Describing Institutions with 
		Archival Holdings* (ISDIAH). See entity types and Add/edit archival institutions.
	
	Archival unit
		Archival unit is a generic term for an aggregation of archival materials. A unit can be a :term:`fonds`, series, 
		file, item, or variation thereof, depending on institutional standards. A unit may be divided into 
		sub-units for the purposes of description: e.g. a :term:`fonds` may contain several series, each of which 
		may contain several files, and so forth. The smallest (and therefore indivisible) unit is the item. See also 
		:term:`level of description`.
		
	Arrangmement
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines arrangement as "the intellectual and 
		physical processes and results of analyzing and organizing documents in accordance with archival principles" (ISAD glossary).
		
	Authority record
		In AtoM, authority records are collections of information about actors - corporate bodies, persons, or families - who interact 
		with archival materials, typically as :term:`creators <creator>`. The :term:`data elements <data element>` used to describe authority records are based on the ICA's 
		*International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families* (ISAAR). ISAAR defines authority record as 
		"The authorized form of name combined with other information elements that identify and describe the named entity and may also point 
		to other related authority records." See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and 
		:doc:`Authority records <../add-edit-content/authority-records>`.
	
	Browse menu
		Browsing allows a user to see all records that have a certain type of :term:`access point` (such as :term:`subject`, :term:`name`, or 
		:term:`place) or other type of filter, such as :term:`media type` or type of :term:`entity`. In AtoM's default theme (the Dominion theme) 
		the browse menu appears in a drop-down next to the :term:`search box`, as well as on the :term:`home page`.
	
	Button block
		The button block allows authorized users to add, edit, delete, move, and duplicate content and to save or cancel changes made 
		in the :term:`edit pages <edit page>`.

	Carousel
		The carousel shows sets of :term:`thumbnails <thumbnail>` of :term:`digital objects <digital object>` and allows the user to scroll through the thumbnails using a mouse or keyboard scroll arrows. It 
		is similar to the `cover flow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_flow>`_ used in "the Macintosh Finder and other Apple Inc. products for visually flipping 
		through snapshots of documents, website bookmarks, album artwork, or photographs. In AtoM a carousel viewer appears at the top of 
		:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` whenever there are associated lower-level descriptions that have digital objects attached.
	
	Child record
		Child record refers to a description of the :term:`archival unit` that is one :term:`level of description` lower than the current unit, 
		e.g. if a series belongs to a :term:`fonds`, the series is the child record of the fonds. See also: :term:`Parent record <parent record>`.
	
	Collection
		In ISAD, a collection is "[a]n artificial assemblage of documents accumulated on the basis of some common characteristic without regard to 
		the provenance of those documents. Not to be confused with an archival fonds." In the Canadian Rules for Archival Description, it is 
		"[a] grouping of documents of any provenance intentionally assembled on the basis of some common characteristic." In Dublin Core, a collection 
		is "[a]n aggregation of resources. A collection is described as a group; its parts may also be separately described."
	
	Context menu
		The context menu appears on all :term:`view <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>` to show the current record's relationships to other records, 
		with links, e.g. they show the hierarchical placement of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` within a :term:`fonds` and the relationship 
		between :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, and archival holdings. See 
		:doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>`. 
	
	Contributor
		A contributor is a type of user who can search, browse, create, and edit descriptions. See :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`.
	
	Controlled vocabulary
		A controlled vocabulary is a set of pre-defined, authorized :term:`terms <term>` grouped into :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>` or entered into 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>` and used for generating :term:`value lists <value list>` and :term:`access points <access point>`. 
		See :doc:`Terms <../add-edit-content/terms>`.
	
	Corporate body
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines a corporate body as "An organization or group of persons that is identified 
		by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an entity" (ISAD glossary).

		Similarly, in the Canadian Rules for Archival Description (RAD), a corporate body is defined as "an organization or association of persons that is identified 
		by a particular name and that acts, or may act, as an entity. Typical examples of corporate bodies are societies, institutions, business firms, nonprofit 
		enterprises, governments, government agencies, religious bodies, places of worship, and conferences."
		
	Create button
		The create button, located on the :term:`button block`, is used to save new :term:`entities <entity>`. Once an entity has been saved for the first time, the 
		create button disappears and is replaced by the "Save" button, which is used to save all subsequent changes.
	
	Creator
		A creator is "any entity (:term:`corporate body`, family or person) that created, accumulated and/or maintained records in the conduct of personal or corporate 
		activity" (ISAAR glossary). In AtoM, the creator is described in an :term:`authority record` linked to an :term:`archival description`, usually at the highest 
		:term:`level of description` only. Lower levels inherit the creator from the :term:`parent record`, unless a different creator is specified. AtoM can accommodate 
		multiple creators at all levels of description. See :ref:`Context area <context-area>`

	Current language
		Refers to the language in which the :term:`user interface` elements and :term:`database content` are displayed. Users can switch between languages by using the 
		:term:`language menu`.
	
	Data element
		Data elements, or elements of description, are `ICA <http://www.ica.org>`_ standards-based units of information applied to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, and :term:`terms <term>`. The elements are entered into fields in AtoM's 
		:term:`edit pages <edit page>`.
	
	Database content
		Database content refers to information stored in Atom's database tables, including :term:`data elements <data element>`, :term:`static page` content, and :term:`user profile` 
		information.
	
	Deaccession record
		The deaccession record is used to indicate that a repository has removed an accession, in part or whole, from the collection. Instead of deleting an :term:`accession record`, 
		the repository will create a deaccession record that is kept.
	
	Default content
		Default content is any :term:`database content` that is included by default when AtoM is installed. This includes things like the default :term:`home page` and :term:`drop-down menu` 
		values that are stored in :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.
	
	Default language
		The default language is the language in which all :term:`user interface` elements are displayed when AtoM is opened. The language is specified when the application is installed. 
		Users can switch to other :term:`supported languages <supported language>` and :term:`translators <translator>` can translate :term:`database content` and :term:`user interface` 
		elements. See :doc:`Choose language <../getting-started/choose-language>` and :ref:`Translate <translate>`.
	
	Delete button
		The delete button appears in the :term:`button block`. Clicking on the delete button will prompt a warning to appear asking whether the user really intends to delete the :term:`entity`.
	
	Delete icon
		Delete icons are small buttons in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` used to delete values from :term:`multi-value fields <multi-value field>`, such as those containing 
		:term:`event` dates or :term:`access points <access point>`.

	Developer
		A developer is a `programmer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer>`_ who is able to modify the underlying software code of an AtoM application.
	
	Digital object
		Digital objects are computer files that can be uploaded into and displayed by AtoM. They include scanned images, digital photographs, sound and moving image files, and other scanned 
		or born-digital items. See :doc:`Upload digital objects <../import-export/upload-digital-object>` and :ref:`File formats <file-formats>`.

	Display standard
		The display standard indicates which archival description standard is used to display and edit the :term:`archival unit`. The default display standard for the application can be set by an 
		:term:`Administrator <administrator>` in the Default template area of the Settings menu. See :doc:`Settings <../administer/settings>`.
		
		AtoM also allows an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions to set which :term:`archival description` standards template is used to display the current description, and if desired, all of its related
		:term:`child records <child record>`. Users can select from multiple standards-based templates supported in AtoM. Using this feature, located in the :term:`Administration area <administration area>` 
		of an :term:`archival description`'s :term:`edit page`, users can choose if archival descriptions held by the same :term:`archival institution` are displayed to end-users with different archival standards templates, 
		or even if different :term:`levels of description <level of description>` in the same :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection` are displayed with different standards templates. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`, 
		:doc:`Descriptive standards <../overview/descriptive-standards>`, and :doc:`Archival descriptions <../add-edit-content/archival-descriptions>`.
	
	Document
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org>`_), in the ISAD glossary, defines a document as "recorded information regardless of medium or characteristics. (See also 
		:term:`Record <record>`)".
	
	Donor dialog
		The dialog that opens when adding donor contact information to the :term:`accession record` or when selecting to edit an existing donor record. Donor records are located under the "Manage" tab in the menu. 
		Donor records are only available to logged-in users with permissions. See: :doc:`Donors <../add-edit-content/donors>`.
	
	Draft record
		A draft record is an :term:`archival description` that has not been published. All new and imported :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` have draft status until the user changes that status 
		to published in the :term:`Administration area <administration area>` the bottom of the archival description :term:`edit page`. The :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can change the 
		default publication status from draft to published in the Admin > Settings > Global > Default publication status.

		The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level of description`. Users who are not authenticated cannot view draft records. See also :term:`Published record <published record>`.
	
	Drop-down menu
		A drop-down list menu is a list of data-entry options that appears below certain :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. Values are drawn from :term:`controlled-vocabulary <controlled vocabulary>` 
		:term:`terms <term>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, and default data contained in AtoM's database tables.
	
	Duplicate button
		The duplicate button appears at the bottom of the :term:`view page`; clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit duplicate`; this page is an :term:`edit page` that is pre-populated 
		with the existing data from the original record. The user can edit the duplicate record page and then save it as a new record. Some users use the duplicate function in toM like a record skeleton when doing 
		large amounts of data-entry on similar records.
	
	Edit button
		The edit button appears at the bottom of :term:`view pages <view page>`; clicking the button takes the user to the :term:`edit page` for that :term:`record`.

		The user can also switch between view and edit pages by clicking the :term:`title bar`.
	
	Edit duplicate
		After the user clicks the :term:`duplicate button` the :term:`edit page` provides a warning. The user is now editing a duplicate record (automatically draft status). After editing the 
		duplicate record the user can click the cancel or save button at the bottom of the screen.
	
	Edit icon
		The edit icon appears in :term:`edit pages <edit page>` next to :term:`fields <field>` that derive data from a related record. The user clicks the icon to edit the text in the related record, e.g. to 
		edit the "Administrative/biographical history" in an :term:`archival description`, the user must click the edit icon because the data resides in the :term:`creator's <creator>` :term:`authority record`.
	
	Edit mode
		Edit mode allows the user to add, modify, or delete the contents of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, 
		:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`terms <term>`, and other database content using :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In edit mode, AtoM displays all 
		:term:`fields <field>` in a :term:`record` for data entry.
	
	Editor
		An editor is a type of user who can search, browse, add, edit and delete :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, 
		:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`, and <:term:`terms <term>`. See :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`.
		
	Edit page
		Edit pages allow users to add, edit and delete the contents of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`, 
		:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`, and <:term:`terms <term>`. They are also used to carry out administrative functions 
		such as changing :term:`user profiles <user profile>` and editing :term:`static pages <static page>`.
	
	Entity
		An entity is an object about which an information system collects data. From the user's perspective, in AtoM there are six main entities: :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions <function>`, :term:`rights records <rights record>`, and <:term:`terms <term>`. 
		See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`.
	
	Error message
		An error message will display when AtoM is unable to execute an action. See :ref:`Error <error>` for examples of types of error messages.
	
	Event
		In AtoM, an event registers an action by an actor (:term:`corporate body`, person, or family) at a particular time or over a span of time and may establish a relationship between the actor and other actors or 
		:term:`entities <entity>`. This is accomplished through the use of start and end dates in the context area of the :term:`archival description`, which links the :term:`creator` or 
		other actor to the records for the period of time delimited by the dates. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and :ref:`Context area <context-area>`.
	
	Field
		A field is a container for a :term:`data element`. Content is added to or modified in fields in :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. For further information, see the Wikipedia entry 
		for `Field <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28computer_science%29>`_.
	
	Field label
		Field labels identify :term:`fields <field>` in :term:`view pages <view page>` and :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. In AtoM, the :term:`Administrator <administrator>` can select 
		certain field labels and hide them from public (unauthorized Users) views. See :doc:`Visible elements <../administer/visible-elements>`.
	
	Finding aid
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines a finding aid as "The broadest term to cover any description or means of reference made or received
		by an archives service in the course of establishing administrative or intellectual control over archival material" (ISAD Glossary)
		
		The finding aid is a tool for discovering information about the :term:`fonds` or :term:`collection`. In AtoM, the entirety of an archival description (including all :term:`child records <child record>` 
		and the :term:`parent record` can be understood as an online finding aid, used for discovery and access. The View archival description screen can also be printed and saved as a Finding Aid in 
		`pdf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format>`_. 
	
	Fonds
		Fonds is an :term:`archival unit` defined as "The whole of the records, regardless of form or medium, organically created and/or accumulated and used by a particular person, family, or 
		:term:`corporate body` in the course of that :term:`creator's <creator>` activities and :term:`functions <function>`." (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, the fonds is by default the highest :term:`level of description`. 
		This default can be changed by :term:`administrators <administrator>` (see :ref:`User interface labels <user-interface-labels>`).
	
	Function
		A function is a type of entity that describes activities linked to records creation, maintenance and use. The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines a
		function as "Any high level purpose, responsibility or task assigned to the accountability agenda of a corporate body by legislation, policy or mandate. Functions may be decomposed
		into sets of co-ordinated operations such as subfunctions, business processes, activities, tasks or transactions" (ISDF Glossary).
		
		Functions in AtoM are linked to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>` and other functions. In AtoM the :term:`fields <field>` for 
		describing functions are taken from the ICA's International Standard for Describing Functions (ISDF). See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>` and :doc:`Functions <../add-edit-content/functions>`.
	
	Global search/replace
		Global search and replace allows :term:`administrators <administrator>` to query the entire database and globally replace specific :term:`terms <term>` in each :term:`field`: title, alternate title, 
		scope and content, bio/admin history etc. The Global search and replace menu can be found under the :term:`Admin menu <admin menu>`. See the Global search and replace menu for a full list of available fields.
	
	Holdings
		Holdings is a generic term referring to the :term:`records <record>` and other materials held by :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`. In AtoM a list of holdings 
		is displayed in the :term:`context menu` on :term:`archival institution` :term:`view pages <view page>`. The list is generated from the titles of :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` 
		that have the :term:`archival institution` selected as a repository (see Context area).  See :doc:`Context menu <../access-content/context-menu>` and :ref:`Context area <context-area>`. 
	
	Home page
		The home page is the first page the user sees when opening the AtoM application. It can also be accessed by clicking the site logo. The content of the home page can be edited by 
		:term:`administrators <administrator>` (see :doc:`Manage static pages <..administer/manage-static-pages>`).
	
	Information area
		Information areas appear on :term:`edit pages <edit page>` and group related :term:`fields <field>` based on the organization of elements of description in `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_ (or other supported) 
		descriptive standards. Clicking on an information area toggles it between closed (all fields in that area hidden) and open (all fields visible).
	
	Information object
		An information object is another term for an :term:`archival description` that can be more broadly applied to any description of a resource, not necessarily archival in origin.
	
	Language menu
		The language menu, located in the top-right corner of the page, allows the user to switch to any of the :term:`supported languages <supported language>` in AtoM. 
		See :doc:`Choose language <../getting-started/choose-language>`; see also :doc:`Default language <../administer/default-language>` and :ref:`Add/remove languages <add-remove-languages>` .

	Level of description
		The level of description is "the position of the unit of description in the hierarchy of the :term:`fonds`" (ISAD glossary). In AtoM, the level of description is 
		selected from a :term:`value list` in the "Identity" area of an :term:`archival description`. See :ref:`Identity area <identity-area>`.
	
	Main menu
		The main menu is the the navigational tool located at the top of all pages for authenticated  (logged in) users. It allows the user to navigate to all the main areas of AtoM.
	
	Master digital object
		The master digital object is the unaltered version of a :term:`digital object` that has been uploaded to AtoM. AtoM automatically generates a :term:`thumbnail` and a 
		:term:`reference display copy` of the object. Only authenticated users may view master digital objects. See :doc:`Upload digital objects <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.
	
	Media type
		Media type refers to the format of uploaded :term:`digital objects <digital object>`. The media type is selected automatically by AtoM when a :term:`digital object` is uploaded 
		and the :term:`thumbnail` and :term:`reference display copies <reference display copy>` of the object are generated. 
		See :doc:`Upload digital objects <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.

		**NOTE:** Media type terms are controlled by the media type :term:`taxonomy`. AtoM ships with five :term:`terms <term>` (audio, image, text, video, other) that are locked; 
		these cannot be edited or deleted because they are referenced by AtoM's code. :term:`Editors <editor>` and :term:`administrators <administrator>` can add new :term:`media type` 
		terms, but unless :term:`developers <developer>` incorporate these into the code, the system will not be able to do anything with them.

	Multi-repository system
		A multi-repository system exists when a single instance of AtoM is used by a :term:`network` of :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>` or other types of repositories.
	
	Multi-value field
		A multi-value field is a :term:`field` that is structured to contain more than one data entry.
	
	Name
		In AtoM, names are registered in :term:`authority records <authority record>` for :term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`, persons, and families who interact with 
		archival materials as e.g. :term:`creators <creator>`, custodians and publishers. Names can be applied as :term:`access points <access point>` to 
		:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. See :ref:`Access points <access-points>`.
	
	Network
		A network is an aggregation of institutions using one instance of AtoM to produce a union list of archival holdings (a :term:`multi-repository system`).
	
	Parent record
		The parent record refers to the description of the :term:`archival unit` that is one :term:`level of description` higher than the current unit. For example, a 
		:term:`fonds` may be the parent record of a series. A parent record may have multiple :term:`child records <child record>`.
	
	Password
		A password is a case-sensitive, unspaced string of characters (alpha-numeric and/or special characters) associated with a :term:`user account` and intended to be kept private, 
		to provide a user with a secure means of logging into the AtoM application. Passwords are required by every user of the system who needs to be able to add, edit, delete, or translate content. 
		The initial passwords are set by the system :term:`administrator` (see :doc:`Manage user accounts <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`) and can subsequently be changed by 
		the user (see :doc:`Change password <../getting-started>`).
		
	Physical storage
		Physical storage is a grouping of :term:`fields <field>` relating to the management of physical objects such as folders, boxes, shelves, and cabinets. 
		In AtoM, users can create and edit information about physical objects by clicking on the "Link physical storage" button in the :term:`button block` of an 
		:term:`archival description`. See :doc:`Physical storage <../add-edit-content/physical-storage>`.
	
	Place
		In AtoM, a place is a geographic location registered in a :term:`taxonomy` and used as an :term:`access point` in :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, 
		:term:`authority records <authority record>`, and :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`.
	
	Print icon
		An icon of a printer is located in the :term:`title bar` of the View Physical storage and Search/Advanced Search results screen. Clicking the icon will allow the user
		to print out a report - the page display will be rendered in a simple black and white for easier printing. See :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.
	
	Published record
		A published record is an :term:`archival description` that has had its status changed from draft to published in the :term:`Administration area <administration area>` 
		at the bottom of the :term:`archival description` :term:`edit page`.
		
		**NOTE:** The publication status is inherited from the highest :term:`level of description`; e.g. when a :term:`fonds` description is changed from draft to published, 
		all :term:`child records <child record>` within the fonds are automatically changed as well. Once archival descriptions have been published, users who are not 
		logged in can view them.
	
	Record
		The International Council on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`_) defines a record as "recorded information in any form or medium, created or received and maintained, by 
		an organization or person in the transaction of business or the conduct of affairs" (ISAD glossary).
		
		The Society of American Archivists (`SAA <http://www2.archivists.org/>`_), which maintains an excellent glossary of `archival terminology <http://www2.archivists.org/glossary>`_, 
		holds several different definitions of a record, including: "data or information in a fixed form that is created or received in the course of individual or 
		institutional activity and set aside (preserved) as evidence of that activity for future reference."

		In AtoM, an :term:`archival description` is used to provide contextual information about and intellectual control over archival materials, which include records.
		
	Reference display copy
		A reference display copy is a low-resolution version of a :term:`master digital object` generated automatically by AtoM on upload. It is used to display images on 
		the :term:`digital object` :term:`view page` when the user clicks on a :term:`thumbnail`, on :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` that have linked
		digital objects, and in the digital object area of :term:`edit pages <edit page>`. See See :doc:`Upload digital objects <../import-export/upload-digital-object>`.
	
	Report icon
		In AtoM a report icon can be found in the right hand :term:`context menu` of an :term:`archival description` :term:`view page`. Clicking on the report icon takes 
		the user to a Reports screen and the choice of printing 3 different reports: File list, Item list, :term:`Physical storage <physical storage>` locations, or a set of Box labels,
		formatted as a `CSV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_. See :ref:`Reports/printing <reports-printing>`.
	
	Researcher
		A researcher is a type of user who is limited to searching and browsing descriptions. See :doc:`User roles <../getting-started/user-roles>`.
