		the top right-hand corner of the page. The content of the about page can be edited by an
		:term:`administrator` (see :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`).

	Accession record
		The accession record is an administrative and descriptive document that summarizes standard
		information about the process of transferring materials to a repository, including
		information about the provenance, contents and legal and physical transfer of the records
		such as, rights and restrictions. See :doc:`Entity types <../overview/entity-types>`

	Access point
		An access point is "A name, term, keyword, phrase or code that may be used to search,
		identify and locate an archival description." (ISAD glossary). In ICA-AtoM, access points
		are derived from authority records and taxonomies created and customized by users. See
		Add/edit terms.

	Access privilege
		Access privileges control the ways a user is able to interact with AtoM. For example,
		some users are able to add and edit content while others may only be able to search and
		browse content. Access privileges are based on defined user roles (see User roles).

	Accrual
		An accrual is "an acquisition additional to a unit of description already held by a 
		repository." (ISAD glossary)

	Add menu
		The "Add" menu allows authorized users to add new archival descriptions, authority records,
		archival institutions, terms, and functions. Only logged-in users can see the "Add" menu.

	Add new button
		The add new button is located in the button block of the view page and allows users to add 
		new records (archival descriptions, authority records, archival institutions, and terms) to 
		ICA-AtoM.

	Admin menu
		The admin menu allows users with administrator access to customize ICA-AtoM to meet 
		institution-specific requirements and to manage user accounts and user profiles
