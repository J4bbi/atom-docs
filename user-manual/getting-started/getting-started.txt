Getting Started
===============

This section describes how to start using AtoM once it has been installed. It
provides a quick orientation to the :ref:`home page <home-page>`, how to log
in and log out, the various :ref:`user roles <user-roles>` in the system, the
main page types a user will encounter, and how to switch languages.

.. _home-page:

Home page
=========

The :term:`home page` is the first thing that a user will see when opening the
AtoM application. :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can customize this to
be a landing page, and from here, users can search, browse, log in as
authenticated users (gaining access to the :term:`main menu`), change the
language of the application interface, and more.

#. Open your web browser and enter the URL of the web server hosting your AtoM
   application. This takes you to your application's home page.
#. On opening, AtoM displays the home page in the configured :term:`default
   language`. In the language menu (top right-hand corner of your page, the
   globe icon in the :term:`header bar`), a user can change the display
   language. For choosing languages, see :ref:`Choose language
   <choose-language>`.
#. On opening, AtoM provides view-only access, so that any user can
   immediately begin searching or browsing the contents of the application,
   using the :term:`search box` or :term:`browse menu`, both located in the
   :term:`header bar`. Any user can also use the :term:`advanced search` link.
   For searching and browsing, see :ref:`Access content <access-content>`.
#. The home page provides a welcome message that can be customized by the
   :term:`administrator`. For customizing the welcome message, see
   :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`.
#. The home page also provides users with an additional :term:`browse menu`
   and a list of the most popular recently visited records in the application.
#. Once a user logs in via the log-in button in the right-hand corner of the
   :term:`header bar`, more options will become available in the :term:`main
   menu`, depending on the user's edit permissions, which are set by an
   :term:`administrator`.
#. To add or edit content, you must have a :term:`user account` and log in.
#. For logging in, see :ref:`log in <log-in>`.
#. For adding and editing, see :ref:`Add/edit content <add-edit-content>`.

.. _log-in:

Log in
======

To add or edit content in AtoM, you need to log in:


* Click the log in link in the :term:`header bar`, located in the upper right-
  hand corner of the page. AtoM routes you to the log in page
* Enter your email address
* Enter your :term:`password`
* Click the log in button

AtoM re-loads the :term:`home page`, now customized to your :term:`user role`.
The :term:`main menu` is now visible. Your :term:`username` will appear where
the log in button was, giving you access to your :term:`user profile`.

To log out, click on your username in the user menu (top right-hand corner). A
:term:`drop-down menu` will appear, with a link to your :term:`user profile`,
and the option to log out. When the log out option is selected, AtoM returns
you to the :term:`home page` (view-only access).

.. note:: AtoM automatically logs you out after thirty minutes of inactivity.
   To resume editing, you will have to log back in


.. _user-roles:

User roles
==========

User roles define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from view-
only access to full administration rights. Your user account in AtoM is tied
to one of five user roles, each representing a different level of access to
the system. User roles are defined by groups that an :term:`administrator` can
add and edit - see :doc:`Manage user accounts <../administer/manage-user-
accounts>` and :doc:`Edit permissions <../administer/edit-permissions>`

.. _user-researcher:

Researcher
----------

A researcher is any user who is not logged in (sometimes called an
unauthenticated user) and therefore has view-only access to the application. A
researcher can search and browse descriptions (published :term:`archival
descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority
record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`)

.. _user-contributor:

Contributor
-----------

By default a contributor can search, browse, create, edit/update, view draft
and export descriptions. The contributor cannot change the :term:`publication
status` of an :term:`information object`. A contributor can access the
:term:`reference <reference display copy>` and :term:`master digital object`.

.. _user-editor:

Editor
------

By default an editor can search, browse, create, edit/update, view draft,
delete and export descriptions and edit :term:`controlled vocabulary`
:term:`terms <term>`. An editor can also change the :term:`publication status`
of an :term:`information object`. An editor can access the :term:`reference
<reference display copy>` and :term:`master digital object`.

.. _user-translator:

Translator
----------

A translator can search and browse :term:`published <published record>`
descriptions and can translate :term:`user interface` elements and
:term:`database content`.

A translator should be able to view :term:`draft descriptions <draft record>`,
but not edit them.

.. _user-administrator:

Administrator
-------------

An administrator can import, export, create, read, update, publish and delete
any record in the system, can customize application to institution specific
requirements, and can manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and
:term:`profiles <user profile>`.

Administrators can also create new user roles , set granular permissions
for that role, and then assign or unassign users from the new role. For
more information on creating a new user role, see :ref:`Add a new group
<add-a-new-group>`.


.. _page-types:

Page types
==========

This section describes the main page types users of AtoM will encounter. The
main page types are:

* :ref:`Home page <page-type-home>`
* :ref:`View <page-type-view>`
* :ref:`Edit <page-type-edit>`
* :ref:`Edit digital object <page-type-edit-object>`
* :ref:`Search results <page-type-search>`
* :ref:`Browse results <page-type-browse>`
* :ref:`Error <page-type-error>`


.. _page-type-home:

Home page
---------

The :term:`home page` is the first page the user sees when opening the
application. It provides basic information about the application, and links
and buttons for user actions (search, browse, log in, log out, get help,
switch language). When the user logs in, the :term:`main menu` becomes visible
in the :term:`header bar`.

The home page is accessible from any other page by clicking the :term:`site
logo` in the :term:`header bar`.

For further information on the features of the :term:`home page`, see the
:ref:`Home page <home-page>` section above.

.. _page-type-view:

View
----

A :term:`view page` displays an individual :term:`record` in full in
:term:`view mode`, showing only those :term:`fields <field>` that contain
data. Logged in users can toggle between :term:`edit mode` and :term:`view
mode` by clicking the :term:`title bar` and can also use the :term:`button
block` to edit or add to the record (i.e. to upload :term:`digital objects
<digital object>`, add :term:`physical storage`, etc.).

Introduced in Release 1.3, view pages now include ellipses in text boxes that
have a large number of characters (e.g., scope and content). The ellipses
allow the User to expand the text box to read the entire body of text. The
collapsed position provides a concise and tidy look to the record so User
don't have to scroll down to understand what they are viewing.

View pages also include ellipses in text boxes that have a large number of
characters (e.g., scope and content, Administrative/biographical history,
Related units of description, etc.). The ellipses, represented in AtoM as 3
dots (...) followed by a >> button, allow the User to expand the text box to
read the entire body of text. The collapsed position provides a concise and
tidy look to the record so User don't have to scroll down to understand what
they are viewing.

.. _page-type-edit:

Edit
----


* Displays an individual record in :term:`edit mode` for data entry.
* Shows all :term:`fields <field>`, including the :term:`administration area`.
* Groups :term:`fields <field>` by collapsible :term:`information areas
  <information area>` - :term:`fields <field>` can be hidden or displayed by
  section.
* Provides :term:`button block` that contains buttons for saving or canceling
  changes.
* Accessible to :term:`contributors <contributor>`, :term:`editors <editor>`,
  and :term:`administrators <administrator>`; not accessible to
  :term:`researchers <researcher>` (for more information on these types of
  users, see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`)

.. _page-type-edit-object:

Edit digital object
-------------------

The Edit digital object page allows the authorized (i.e. logged in) User with
edit privileges to control the rights applied to the :term:`master digital
object`, the :term:`reference display copy`, and the :term:`thumbnail`
representation (copy used within the database for search results, image
gallery, :term:`carousel` etc.), as well as upload a new :term:`reference
display copy` or :term:`thumbnail` associated with a :term:`master digital
object`.

.. _page-type-search:

Search results
--------------

A search results page displays set of records that match search criteria,
based on a user's query entered into the :term:`search box` or the
:term:`advanced search` menu. Users can click on the title of a record listed
in the search results page to open the record in :term:`view mode`.

.. _page-type-browse:

Browse results
--------------

Browse results show lists of descriptions retrieved by clicking on an item in
the :term:`browse menu`. By default when the application is installed, results
for :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority
records <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival
institution>` and :term:`functions <function>` are sorted by most recently
updated for authenticated (i.e. logged in) users, and alphabetically for non-
logged in users such as :term:`researchers <researcher>`; however, a
:term:`drop-down menu` at the top-right of the browse results allows a user to
change the sort order. Additionally, an :term:`administrator` can change the
default sort order for both types of users via the Settings menu (see:
:ref:`Settings <settings>`). Users can also browse by :term:`subject`,
:term:`place`, and :term:`digital object` type.

.. _page-type-error:

Error
-----

An :term:`error message` displays when AtoM is unable to execute an action.
The following are typical types of :term:`error messages <error message>`:

* **Page not found:** usually implies a broken link; report to system
  :term:`administrator` and to AtoM support team.
* **No access permission:** your user account does not give you access
  privileges to the requested page.
* **Locked term:** the :term:`term` cannot be edited because it is referenced
  in the underlying AtoM application code
* **No translation permission:** you do not have :term:`translator` access in
  the current language, or to the specific description
* **System error (500 internal server error):** indicates a fairly major
  system-wide problem, or problem with data corruption; report to
  :term:`administrator`.
* **Blank page:** indicates a fairly major system-wide problem, or problem
  with data corruption; report to administrator and to AtoM support team.


.. _choose-language:

Choose language
===============

Any user can change the :term:`current language` to one of AtoM's
:term:`supported languages <supported language>` by clicking on a language in
the :term:`language menu`, located in the AtoM :term:`header bar`. AtoM
switches the :term:`user interface` to the preferred language, and:

* if a translation of the database content into the preferred language exists,
  AtoM switches to the translation;
* if **no** translated version exists, AtoM displays the description in its
  original source version.

.. note::
   **SEE Also:** :ref:`Add/remove languages <add-remove-languages>` for
   information on how an :term:`administrator` can remove or restore languages
   in the :term:`language menu`, and :ref:`Translate <translate-all>` for how
   to translate in AtoM

.. _change-password:

Change password
===============

Users can change their own :term:`passwords <password>`. If a user forgets his
or her :term:`password`, the system :term:`administrator` must reset it (see
:doc:`Manage user accounts <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`).

#. Click your :term:`username` in the :term:`header bar`, at the upper
   right-hand corner of the page
#. A :term:`drop-down menu` will appear with the option to log out, or
   navigate to your :term:`user profile` - click on "Profile"
#. Enter your new :term:`password` under "Change password" and enter it again
   under "Confirm password".
#. Click the "Save" button

Your password has now been updated. The new password will be in effect next
time you log in to the application.
