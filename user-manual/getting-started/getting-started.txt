Getting Started
===============

This section describes how to start using AtoM once it has been installed. It
provides a quick orientation to the :ref:`home page <home-page>`, how to log
in and log out, the various :ref:`user roles <user-roles>` in the system, the
main page types a user will encounter, and how to switch languages.

.. _home-page:

Home page
=========

The :term:`home page` is the first thing that a user will see when opening the
AtoM application. :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can customize this to
be a landing page, and from here, users can search, browse, log in as
authenticated users (gaining access to the :term:`main menu`), change the
language of the application interface, and more.

#. Open your web browser and enter the URL of the web server hosting your AtoM
   application. This takes you to your application's home page.
#. On opening, AtoM displays the home page in the configured :term:`default
   language`. In the language menu (top right-hand corner of your page, the
   globe icon in the :term:`header bar`), a user can change the display
   language. For choosing languages, see :ref:`Choose language
   <choose-language>`.
#. On opening, AtoM provides view-only access, so that any user can
   immediately begin searching or browsing the contents of the application,
   using the :term:`search box` or :term:`browse menu`, both located in the
   :term:`header bar`. Any user can also use the :term:`advanced search` link.
   For searching and browsing, see :ref:`Access content <access-content>`.
#. The home page provides a welcome message that can be customized by the
   :term:`administrator`. For customizing the welcome message, see
   :doc:`Manage static pages <../administer/manage-static-pages>`.
#. The home page also provides users with an additional :term:`browse menu`
   and a list of the most popular recently visited records in the application.
#. Once a user logs in via the log-in button in the right-hand corner of the
   :term:`header bar`, more options will become available in the :term:`main
   menu`, depending on the user's edit permissions, which are set by an
   :term:`administrator`.
#. To add or edit content, you must have a :term:`user account` and log in.
#. For logging in, see :ref:`log in <log-in>`.
#. For adding and editing, see :ref:`Add/edit content <add-edit-content>`.

.. _log-in:

Log in
======

To add or edit content in AtoM, you need to log in:


* Click the log in link in the :term:`header bar`, located in the upper right-
  hand corner of the page. AtoM routes you to the log in page
* Enter your email address
* Enter your :term:`password`
* Click the log in button

AtoM re-loads the :term:`home page`, now customized to your :term:`user role`.
The :term:`main menu` is now visible. Your :term:`username` will appear where
the log in button was, giving you access to your :term:`user profile`.

To log out, click on your username in the user menu (top right-hand corner). A
:term:`drop-down menu` will appear, with a link to your :term:`user profile`,
and the option to log out. When the log out option is selected, AtoM returns
you to the :term:`home page` (view-only access).

.. note:: AtoM automatically logs you out after thirty minutes of inactivity.
   To resume editing, you will have to log back in


.. _user-roles:

User roles
==========

User roles define levels of access to functions in AtoM, ranging from view-
only access to full administration rights. Your user account in AtoM is tied
to one of five user roles, each representing a different level of access to
the system. User roles are defined by groups that an :term:`administrator` can
add and edit - see :doc:`Manage user accounts <../administer/manage-user-
accounts>` and :doc:`Edit permissions <../administer/edit-permissions>`

.. _user-researcher:

Researcher
----------

A researcher is any user who is not logged in (sometimes called an
unauthenticated user) and therefore has view-only access to the application. A
researcher can search and browse descriptions (published :term:`archival
descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority
record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`)

.. _user-contributor:

Contributor
-----------

By default a contributor can search, browse, create, edit/update, view draft
and export descriptions. The contributor cannot change the :term:`publication
status` of an :term:`information object`. A contributor can access the
:term:`reference <reference display copy>` and :term:`master digital object`.

.. _user-editor:

Editor
------

By default an editor can search, browse, create, edit/update, view draft,
delete and export descriptions and edit :term:`controlled vocabulary`
:term:`terms <term>`. An editor can also change the :term:`publication status`
of an :term:`information object`. An editor can access the :term:`reference
<reference display copy>` and :term:`master digital object`.

.. _user-translator:

Translator
----------

A translator can search and browse :term:`published <published record>`
descriptions and can translate :term:`user interface` elements and
:term:`database content`.

A translator should be able to view :term:`draft descriptions <draft record>`,
but not edit them.

.. _user-administrator:

Administrator
-------------

An administrator can import, export, create, read, update, publish and delete
any record in the system, can customize application to institution specific
requirements, and can manage :term:`user accounts <user account>` and
:term:`profiles <user profile>`.

Administrators can also create new user roles , set granular permissions
for that role, and then assign or unassign users from the new role. For
more information on creating a new user role, see :ref:`Add a new group
<add-a-new-group>`.
