The Browse menus in AtoM allow users to browse complete lists of
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, as well as digital objects,
:term:`authority records <authority record>` (for people and organizations),
places, subjects and :term:`functions <function>`. In
:term:`multi-repository installations <multi-repository system>`, users can
also browse :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`.

Most browse functions are available for all users, authenticated (logged-in)
or not. Browsing options available only to authenticated users, including
donors and :term:`accession records <accession record>`, are outlined below.

Browsing for all users
======================

From any page in AtoM in the default theme, the :term:`Dominion theme`, the
following browse options are available from the drop-down :term:`browse menu`
beside the :term:`search box` in the :term:`header bar`.

The browse options listed below are in their default order, however,
adminstrative users can change the order, or remove browse options, through
the Admin-Menus menu (see: :ref:`Manage menus <manage-menus>`).

   :alt: View of browsing archival descriptions

This browse screen shows all :term:`archival descriptions <archival
description>` regardless of the :term:`level of description`. The automatic
sort is alphabetic by default for public users, but users can change the sort
to most recently updated, using the :ref:`sort button <recurring-sort-button>`
located at the top-right of the page above the results.

.. TIP::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can change the default sort order
   on search/browse pages for both public and authenticated (i.e. logged in)
   users, in **Admin > Settings > Global**. For more information, see:
   :ref:`sort-browser-users` and :ref:`sort-browser-anonymous`.

Users can narrow the results list using the available
:term:`facet filters <facet filter>` on the left-hand side of the screen. For
more information on using the facet filters in AtoM, see:
:ref:`recurring-facet-filters`; especially
:ref:`Using facet filters in AtoM <using-facet-filters>`.


At the top of the :term:`archival description` browse page's list of results,
the number of descriptions with :term:`digital objects <digital object>` is
available and the user can click to see only results with digital objects.

.. image:: images/browse-descriptions-pager.*
   :align: right
   :width: 30%
   :alt: Image of the pager provided on browse pages with more than 10
         results

By default, AtoM will display 10 results per page; if there are more than 10
descriptions, a pager will be provided at the bottom of the results.

.. TIP::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can change the default number of
   results returned per page in **Admin > Settings > Global**. For more
   information, see: :ref:`results-page`.

Browse people, families and organizations
-----------------------------------------

In AtoM, people, families and organizations (also referred to as
:term:`corporate bodies <corporate body>`) are :term:`entities <entity>` which
are controlled by :term:`authority records <authority record>`.

Any of these entities can be browsed in the Browse menu. Click the Browse
menu, then click on People and organizations.

which for :term:`authority records <authority record>` includes language and
