The AtoM Search box |searchbox|
===============================

.. |searchbox| image:: images/search-box.png
   :height: 30px

The search box is the primary means to find descriptions in AtoM that contain
text matching a search query. The search box is located in the
:term:`header bar` on all AtoM pages, including the home page. By default,
when a user enters text and presses enter, the results returned are for
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. However, other
record-type results can be discovered via the :term:`typeahead` results
presented in the search box (see: :ref:`below <search-typeahead>`).

Search terms entered in the search box are, by default, searched with an "OR"
operator - that is to say, searching for *kitty cat* would by default search
*kitty* OR *kat*. AtoM supports a number of :term:`Boolean <boolean search>`
operators - see: :ref:`Advanced search <advanced-search>`.

Typeahead and faceted search box results

   As a user types, typeahead search suggestions appear below the search box.

Additionally, the AtoM search box also implements :term:`typeahead` - as a user
enters text into the search box, one or more possible matches are found and
presented to the user in a :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` below the search
box, which continue to narrow as the user enters further text. This allows a
user to dynamically view results and select a resource without necessarily
having to enter its full name or title. The search box :term:`typeahead`
results are organized into record-type categories (or :term:`facets <facet
filter>`), including:

* :term:`Archival description`
* :term:`Authority record`
* :term:`Archival institution`

When multiple results for a record type exist, the :term:`typeahead`
drop-down includes an option to view all records for a particular record
type - clicking the "View all" link for a particular type of record will
redirect the user to a browse page of results.

The :term:`typeahead` is set by default to begin providing suggestions only
after at least three characters have been entered - for example, entering "a"
or "an" in the search box will not prompt suggestions, but entering "ant"
might produce suggestions such as an authority record for a person named
"Anthony," etc.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The :term:`typeahead` search results are intended as a navigational tool
   for quick searching of multiple :ref:`entity types <entity-types>`, but
   **by default pressing enter after entering a query in the search bar will
   load a results page for archival descriptions**. If you wish to search for
   an :term:`authority record` or :term:`archival institution` using the main
   search box, you must either click it when it appears in the drop-down, or
   alternately select it from a browse page when clicking the "all matching"
   option below each search facet in the typeahead. At this time, the main
   :term:`search box` cannot be configured to return other record types when
   pressing enter. However, there are also dedicated search bars for authority
   records and archival institutions -- see :ref:`below <dedicated-search>`.

.. _search-box-delimiters:

Search box delimiters
---------------------

.. figure:: images/search-delimiter.*
   :align: right
   :figwidth: 40%
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Example of the search delimiters below the search box

   When viewing an archival description linked to an archival institution, or
   the institution record, the option to limit your search to the current
   institution appears as a radio button in a drop-down beneath the search
   box.

Additionaly, when a user has viewed an :term:`archival institution` record or
an :term:`archival description` related to an archival institution, clicking
in the search box will reveal a set of :term:`radio buttons <radio button>`
that allow the user limit the search results to the holdings of the most
recently viewed :term:`archival institution`, or to search globally (i.e.,
across all records in the application). Help text appears in the
:term:`search box` to indicate at a glance which setting is engaged: if the
search box text says "Search", the delimiter is set to perform a global
search. If the help text says "Search [Name of Institution]" (where the name
of the current related institution appears), this indicates that the
delimiter is set to limit search box query results to the :term:`holdings` of
that institution.

.. NOTE::

   When a user views a linked :term:`archival description` or an
   :term:`archival institution` record, the :term:`search box` delimiter will
   **default to search within that institution**. If you would like to
   perform a global search (i.e. across all records in the application),
   switch the radio button to *Global search* before proceeding. See below
   for further instructions on using the search box delimiters.

When the delimiter is set to limit search results to a specific
:term:`archival institution`, :term:`typeahead` search results for
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` will also be limited to
the :term:`holdings` of that institution. However, other typehead results,
such as :term:`authority record` and :term:`archival institution`
suggestions, will **not** be limited (instead AtoM will continue to make
suggestions from all records in the application for those types).

If a user enters a search query in the :term:`search box` while the delimiter.
is set to a particular :term:`repository`, the :ref:`search results
<page-type-search>` page will include a **filter tag** at the top of the
results, to offer a visual cue to the user that the results are limited to
those of a specific :term:`archival institution`. Clicking the "**X**" on the
filter tag will remove it, and the results page will reload and display
global search results. This offers two advantages to the user:

* When a delimited search is performed, the user is given a clear visual
  indication (the filter tag bearing the :term:`repository` name)
* If a delimited search is performed *by accident* (i.e. the user meant to
  perform a global search), the filter can be removed without having to
  perform the search again.

**USING THE SEARCH BOX DELIMITERS**

1. Navigate to an :term:`archival description` linked to an :term:`archival
   institution`, or to an archival institution's page. You can do this either
   by searching for the name of the institution or description, or by
   :ref:`browsing <browse>`.
2. Place your cursor in the :term:`search box` located in the AtoM
   :term:`header bar`. A :term:`drop-down menu` will appear beneath the search
   box with two radio buttons.
3. By default, the radio button will be set to the related :term:`archival
   institution`. If you would like to search within the :term:`holdings` of
   that institution, you can begin typing your query.
4. If you would like to search all records held in AtoM (i.e. globally), click
   the "Global search" radio button in the :term:`drop-down <drop-down
   menu>`. Begin typing your query.
5. If you see the result you are looking for appear in the :ref:`typeahead
   <search-typeahead>`, you can click it to go straight to the record - AtoM
   will redirect you to the selected description's :term:`view page`.
6. When you have entered your search term(s), press enter to submit and begin
   your search. AtoM will redirect you to a :ref:`search results
   <page-type-search>` page with descriptions that contain data that match
   your search query.
7. The search results page includes a number :ref:`facet filters <facet
   filter>`, to help you sort through the results and find the content you are
   looking for. For more information on working with facet filters, see:
   :ref:`recurring-facet-filters`.
8. Search results can be sorted either alphabetically, or by most-recently
   updated, using the :term:`sort button` available at the top-left side of
   the search results. For more information, see:
   :ref:`recurring-sort-button`.
