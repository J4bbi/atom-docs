The AtoM Search box |searchbox|
===============================

.. |searchbox| image:: images/search-box.png
   :height: 30px

The search box is the primary means to find descriptions in AtoM that contain
text matching a search query. The search box is located in the
:term:`header bar` on all AtoM pages, including the home page. By default,
when a user enters text and presses enter, the results returned are for
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`. However, other
record-type results can be discovered via the :term:`typeahead` results
presented in the search box (see: :ref:`below <search-typeahead>`).

Search terms entered in the search box are, by default, searched with an "OR"
operator - that is to say, searching for *kitty cat* would by default search
*kitty* OR *kat*. AtoM supports a number of :term:`Boolean <boolean search>`
operators



.. _search-typeahead:

Typeahead and faceted search box results
-----------------------------------------

Additionally, the AtoM search box also implements :term:`typeahead` - as a user
enters text into the search box, one or more possible matches are found and
presented to the user in a :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` below the search
box, which continue to narrow as the user enters further text. This allows a
user to dynamically view results and select a resource without necessarily
having to enter its full name or title. The search box :term:`typeahead`
results are organized into record-type categories (or :term:`facets <facet
filter>`), including:

* :term:`Archival description`
* :term:`Authority record`
* :term:`Archival institution`
* :term:`Subject`
* :term:`Place`

When multiple results for a record type exist, the :term:`typeahead`
drop-down includes an option to view all records for a particular record
type - clicking the "View all" link for a particular type of record will
redirect the user to a browse page of results.

The :term:`typeahead` is set by default to begin providing suggestions only
after at least three characters have been entered - for example, entering "a"
or "an" in the search box will not prompt suggestions, but entering "ant"
might produce suggestions such as an authority record for a person named
"Anthony," etc.

Search box delimiters
---------------------

Additionaly, when a user has viewed an :term:`archival institution` record or
an :term:`archival description` related to an archival institution, clicking
in the search box will reveal a set of :term:`radio buttons <radio button>`
that allow the user limit the search results to the holdings of the most
recently viewed :term:`archival institution`, or to search globally (i.e.,
across all records in the application).
