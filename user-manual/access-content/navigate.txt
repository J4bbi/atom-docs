Navigation in AtoM
==================

This section introduces users to key navigation elements in AtoM, as well as
recurring page elements that can be used to perform a variety of functions
throughout the application. Navigating involves understanding the current
location (:ref:`entity <entity-types>` and page), what can be done from that
location (view, edit, add new, search, etc.), how to get related
:ref:`entities <entity-types>`, and how to go to other pages to do other
things unrelated to the current entity.

**Below you'll find an introduction to:**

.. _atom-header-bar:

The AtoM Header Bar
===================

The :term:`header bar` is the primary means to access, manage, and
create content in AtoM. It is persistent, meaning it remains available on all
pages throughout the application. The :term:`header bar` includes the log-in
button, :term:`language menu`, :term:`search box`, :term:`browse menu`, and
:term:`site logo` for all users, and the :term:`main menu` for authenticated
(i.e. logged in) users.

   :width: 80%
   :alt: An image of the AtoM Header bar for unauthenticated users

.. raw:: html

 <br />

Additionally, an :term:`administrator` can add a :term:`site title` and a
:term:`site description` via **Admin > Settings > Site information**, and
then determine whether or not these are visible in the :term:`header bar` via
**Admin > Settings > Default page elements**. The visibility of the :term:`site
logo` can also be controlled via Default page elements. For more information
see :ref:`Settings <settings>`.

The :term:`main menu` only becomes visible in the :term:`header bar` after a
user has logged in. Depending on a user's :term:`access privileges <access
privilege>`, the :term:`main menu` may show/hide different options - for
example, only :term:`administrators <administrator>` will see the
:term:`Admin menu`. Access privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles
<user role>` (see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`).

.. _log-in-button:

|login| Log-in button
=====================

.. |login| image:: images/login.png

The log-in button, located in the :term:`header bar`, directs unauthenticated
(i.e. not logged in) users to a log in screen where users with a :term:`user
account` can enter their credentials (email and password) to log into the
application. Once a user has successfully logged in, the log-in button will
display their chosen user name. Clicking on the log-in button after logging in
will reveal a :term:`drop-down menu` with the option to log out, or to visit
the user's profile page, where a user can upate their credentials (username,
email, password).

.. _language-menu:

|globe2| Language menu
======================

.. |globe2| image:: images/globe.png
   :height: 23
   :width: 23

The :term:`language menu`, located in the :term:`header bar` in the top-right
corner of the page, allows the user to switch to any of the
:term:`supported languages <supported language>` in AtoM. It is available to
all users (whether or not they are logged in). It is represented by a |globe|
icon - clicking the globe icon will reveal a :term:`drop-down menu` that
lists the available languages. When a user selects a language from the menu,
the page will reload and all translated interface elements (such as menus,
edit templates, :term:`tooltips`, labels, help text, etc.) will appear in the
selected language, and will remain in the selected language until the user
changes the language again.

.. |globe| image:: images/globe.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18

* For more information on changing the language, see: :ref:`Choose language
  <choose-language>`

:ref:`Back to top <navigate>`

.. _main-menu:

Main menu
=========

The :term:`main menu`  is a navigational tool appears in the AtoM
:term:`header bar` for authenticated (i.e. logged in) users. It consists of 4
sub-menus, represented by icons:

* :ref:`Add <main-menu-add>` - represented by a |plus| icon
* :ref:`Manage <main-menu-manage>` - represented by a |pencil| icon
* :ref:`Import <main-menu-import>` - represented by a |import| icon
* :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` - represented by a |gears| icon

.. |plus| image:: images/plus-sign.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18
.. |pencil| image:: images/edit-sign.png
   :height: 18

   :height: 18
   :width: 18
.. |gears| image:: images/gears.png
   :height: 18
   :width: 18

Each sub-menu is designed as a :term:`drop-down menu` - hovering over an icon
in the :term:`main menu` will cause a :term:`tooltip <tooltips>` to appear
with the name of the sub-menu (Add, Manage, Import, or Admin). Clicking on
one of the icons will cause the drop-down to reveal the options available.

Access to the elements of the main menu (the sub-menus) depends on the
:term:`access privileges <access privilege>` associated with each user
account. Consequently, some users may not see some of the icons for the
sub-menus in the :term:`main menu` after logging in. Access privileges are
determined by the :term:`user role` associated with a :term:`user account` -
for example, a :term:`contributor` will see the :ref:`Add <main-menu-add>`
and :ref:`Manage <main-menu-manage>` menus, but not the :ref:`Import
<main-menu-import>` or :ref:`Admin <main-menu-admin>` menus. Only
:term:`adminstrators <administrator>` will see all 4 sub-menus (Add,
Manage, Import, Admin) in the :term:`main menu`.

* For information on user roles, see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`
* For information on managing User accounts see: :doc:`Manage user accounts
  <../administer/manage-user-accounts>`.
* For information on changing the permissions associated with an account or a
  group, see: :doc:`Edit user permissions
  <../administer/edit-user-permissions>`

.. TIP::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can add and remove options in the
   sub-menus (Add, Manage, Import, Admin) of the main menu via **Admin >
   Menus**. For more information, see :doc:`Manage menus
   <../administer/manage-menus>`

.. image:: images/add-menu.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of the Add menu's options

The Add menu's options will redirect users to blank records in :term:`edit
mode`, ready for data entry. Using the Add menu, users can quickly create new
:term:`accession records <accession record>`, :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`functions <function>`,
and :term:`terms <term>`.

All records are created independently of other records, and will not be a
part of a pre-existing hierarchy - that is to say, they will be top-level
records.

.. image:: images/manage-menu.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of the Manage menu's options

The Manage menu allows authenticated (i.e. logged in) users to quickly access
browse lists for key :ref:`entity types <entity-types>` in AtoM -
:term:`accessions <accession record>`, donors, :term:`physical storage`,
:term:`rights holders <rights record>`, and :term:`taxonomies <taxonomy>`.
When selecting from the Manage menu's :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>`, the
user is redirected to a browse page for the selected :term:`entity` or record
type.

The Manage menu is distinct from the :term:`Browse menu` (available next to
the :term:`search box` in the :term:`header bar`), in that it offers users
direct access to browse pages that are not available to unauthenticated (i.e.
not logged in) users - public users who are not logged in cannot view
accessions, donor records, physical storage locations, rights records, or
access the full taxonomies list.

.. image:: images/import-menu.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of the Import menu's options

The import menu allows authenticated (i.e. logged in) users with sufficient
:term:`access privileges <access privilege>` to import records into the
application. By default, only :term:`administrators <administrator>` have
access to the import menu - however, administrators can also change user
and group permissions (see: :doc:`Edit permissions
<../administer/edit-user-permissions>` and :doc:`Manage user accounts
<../administer/manage-user-accounts>`).

Two options are offered in the dropdown menu - XML (short for `eXtensible
Markup Language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml>`__) and CSV (short for
`Comma-Separated Values
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`__). Selecting one of
the options from the Import :term:`drop-down menu` will redirect the user to
an import page specific to the format chosen. Using these options, an
:term:`administrator` can import descriptions and :term:`terms <term>` into
AtoM.

.. image:: images/admin-menu.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of the Admin menu's options

The admin menu allows users with :term:`administrator <administrator>`
access to customize AtoM to meet institution-specific requirements and
to manage :term:`user accounts <user account>`, :term:`user
profiles <user profile>` and :term:`access privileges <access privilege>`. An
administrator can also create and manage :term:`static pages <static page>`,
alter application menus, change the visibility of elements in the
:term:`header bar`, and change other application default settings.


By default, the admin menu is only visible to users with :term:`administrator`
privileges. However, an :term:`administrator` can also change user and group
permissions (:term:`access privileges <access privilege>`) via the Admin
menu.

.. _browse-menu:

|browse-menu| Browse menu
=========================

.. |browse-menu| image:: images/browse-menu.png

.. image:: images/browse-menu-full.*
   :align: right
   :width: 25%
   :alt: An image of the Browse menu's options

The browse menu provides persistent access to browse pages for some of AtoM's
key :ref:`entity types <entity-types>`. Browsing allows a user to see all
records that have a certain type of :term:`access point` (such as
:term:`subject`, :term:`name`, or :term:`place`) or other type of filter,
such as :term:`media type` or  type of :term:`entity`. Users can then browse
through the results provided, and/or further narrow the results via the use
of :term:`facet filters <facet filter>`.

In AtoM's default theme (the :term:`Dominion theme`) the browse menu appears
in a :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` next to the :ref:`search box
<search-box>` in the :ref:`header bar <atom-header-bar>` on all pages. The
:term:`drop-down menu` contains links to browse pages for :term:`archival
descriptions <archival description>`, :term:`authority records <authority
record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`,
:term:`subjects <subject>`, :term:`places <place>`, and :term:`digital
objects <digital object>`.

Additionally, a browse menu is included on the :term:`home page` when users
first :ref:`log in <log-in>` to the application.

**For more information on browsing in AtoM see:** :ref:`Browse <browse>`

.. TIP::

   :term:`Administrators <administrator>` can change what links appear in the
   browse menu (and all menus) via **Admin > Menus**. For more information,
   see: :ref:`Manage menus <manage-menus>`.


:ref:`Back to top <navigate>`

.. _search-box:

Search box |searchbox|
=======================

.. |searchbox| image:: images/search-box.png
   :height: 30px

The search box is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text
matching a search query. The search box is located in the
:term:`header bar` on all AtoM pages, including the home page. By default,
when a user enters text and presses enter, the results returned are for
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`.

However, the AtoM search box also implements :term:`typeahead` - as a user
enters text into the search box, one or more possible matches are found and
presented to the user in a :term:`drop-down <drop-down menu>` below the search
box, which continue to narrow as the user enters further text. This allows a
user to dynamically view results and select a resource without necessarily
having to enter its full name or title. The search box :term:`typeahead`
results are organized into record-type categories (or :term:`facets <facet
filter>`), including:

* :term:`Archival description`
* :term:`Authority record`
* :term:`Archival institution`
* :term:`Subject`
* :term:`Place`

When multiple results for a record type exist, the :term:`typeahead`
drop-down includes an option to view all records for a particular record
type - clicking the "View all" link for a particular type of record will
redirect the user to a browse page of results.

Additionaly, when a user has viewed an :term:`archival institution` record,
clicking in the search box will reveal a set of :term:`radio buttons <radio
button>` that allow the user limit the search results to the holdings of the
most recently viewed :term:`archival institution`, or to search globally
(i.e., across all records in the application).

**For more information on searching in AtoM, see:** :doc:`Search
<../access-content/search>`

.. _site-logo-element:

|site-logo| Site logo
=====================

.. |site-logo| image:: images/site-logo.png
   :scale: 80%

The :term:`site logo` is the graphic that appears at the top of all pages in
the left-hand corner of the :term:`header bar` in AtoM. Clicking on
the logo will take the user to the :term:`home page`. AtoM ships with
a default logo that can be replaced by :term:`administrators <administrator>`
to theme the application to their own institution or :term:`network` if
desired: see :ref:`Site logo <site-logo>`.

.. TIP::

   Users who do not have a logo, or who simply want to add a
   :term:`site title` to the :term:`header bar`, can do so via **Admin >
   Settings > Site information**, and make it visible in the :term:`header bar`
   via **Admin > Settings > Default page elements**. The :term:`site title`,
   when visible, will also act as a hyperlink to the :term:`home page`. To
   add and control the visibility of the site title, you must be an
   :term:`administrator`. For more information, see :ref:`Settings <settings>`.

.. _recurring-page-elements:

Recurring page elements
=======================

This section outlines :term:`user interface` elements that appear throughout
the AtoM application on different :ref:`page types <page-types>`.
Understanding how these reoccurring page elements are used in the application
will improve a user's ability to navigate the application effectively.
Recurring page elements listed below include:

* :ref:`Title bar <recurring-title-bar>`
* :ref:`Text links <recurring-text-links>`
* :ref:`Context menu <recurring-context-menu>`
* :ref:`Column headers <recurring-column-headers>`

Title bar
---------

.. image:: images/title-bar.*
  :align: right
  :width: 45%
  :alt: An image of the title bar on an archival description

The :term:`title bar` is a contextual element that appears throughout AtoM on
various different :ref:`page types <page-types>`, offering the user an
indication of the type of page, and/or the name of the record, currently being
viewed.

On a :term:`view <view page>` or :term:`edit <edit page>` page, the
:term:`title bar` displays the name (title) of the current entity. The
title bar appears at the top of core :ref:`entity <entity-types>`
records in AtoM, including :term:`archival descriptions <archival
description>`, :term:`authority records <authority record>`,
:term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`, :term:`functions
<function>`, and :term:`terms <term>` (such as :term:`subjects <subject>`
and :term:`places <place>`), as well as at the top of :term:`physical
storage` locations. On :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`,
the title bar also displays the :term:`level of description` of the displayed
description.

.. image:: images/title-bar-browse-search.*
  :align: right
  :width: 45%
  :alt: An image of the title bar on a search results page

On Donor and :term:`accession <accession record>` records, the title bar
displays a message indicating whether the record is in :term:`view <view mode>`
or :term:`edit <edit mode>` mode, with the record's name/title display below
(as a sub-title).

On :ref:`Browse <browse>` and :doc:`Search <../access-content/search>` pages,
the :term:`title bar` displays the number of results returned for the current
query. Elsewhere in the application, the title bar gives context to the user
about the :ref:`page type <page-types>` currently being viewed.

.. _recurring-text-links:

Text links
----------

Blue text always represents a link to a related entity (for example,  from an
:term:`archival description` to the :term:`authority record` of the record's
:term:`creator`). When you hover your cursor over a link, the text darkens in
color. Text links behave similarly to internet `hyperlinks
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink>`__, and can be used as navigational
elements: clicking on a text link will cause AtoM to redirect a user to the
related record referenced in the text of the text link.

.. NOTE::

   Some text links are white in the ArchivesCanada theme, such as in the
   :term:`context menu` (including the :term:`treeview`) and the
   :term:`breadcrumb trail` at the top of many :term:`entity` :term:`view
   pages <view page>`. Text links in the :term:`Dominion theme` included as
   the default theme in AtoM are almost universally blue.

.. _recurring-context-menu:

Context menu
------------

The context menu appears on all :term:`view <view page>` and some
:term:`edit pages <edit page>` to provide greater contextual information
about the record currently being viewed.

AtoM's :term:`view <view page>` and :term:`edit <edit page>` pages are
generally displayed in the :term:`user interface` in either a 2 or 3 column
layout - the current record's display data is presented in the central part
of the page, while the side column(s) are generally used to provide
additional options and further contextual information to enhance user
orientation and navigation.

   :alt: Example of the context menu on an archival description

   Context menu (on left and right sides) on an archival description


On :term:`archival description` :term:`view pages <view page>`, this includes
the name and/or :ref:`logo <recurring-institution-logos>` of the
:term:`archival institution` or :term:`repository` who holds the
:term:`archival unit` the current record describes, and the
:term:`treeview`, which shows the current record's relationships to other
records, with links, on the left-hand side of the screen. The right-hand
side of the screen includes links to related people and organizations (i.e.,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`), :term:`subjects <subject>`, and
:term:`places <place>`, as well as available formats for export and printing.
Links in the right-hand column of the context menu are drawn from

When viewing an :term:`authority record` for a person, family, or
:term:`corporate body`, the left-hand side of the screen will show any
relationships with :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, where
the agent (the person, family, or corporate body described in the
:term:`authority record`) is linked as either a :term:`creator` (or as an
agent in any other :term:`event`), or when added as a name :term:`access
point`. The right-hand column of the page includes available export formats.

.. NOTE::

   When a relationship is created between two :term:`authority records
   <authority record>` or between an authority record and a :term:`function`,
   the relationship is expressed in the body (i.e. the main part or center
   column) of the authority record's :term:`view page`, in the "Relationships"
   :term:`area <information area>` of the record.

When viewing an :ref:`ISDIAH <isdiah-template>` record for an
:term:`archival institution`, the context menu displays the institution's logo
and a list of holdings on the left-hand side, with contact information for the
:term:`repository` provided on the right-hand side of the record. The contact
information is drawn from the information added to the "Contact"
:term:`area <information area>` of the :term:`archival institution` record.

On :ref:`Browse <browse>` and :doc:`Search <../access-content/search>` pages,
the context menu includes :term:`facet filters <facet filter>` that allow the
user to iteratively narrow the results presented. If the browse page is for a
:term:`term` that can be organized hierarchically in a :term:`taxonomy` (such
as a :term:`place` or :term:`subject` term), a version of the
:term:`treeview` is also presented, showing users the terms position in the
hierarchy as well as related "sibling" (i.e. on the same level) terms.

   Name and Updated column headers in the Browse Rights holders page

:term:`Column headers <column header>` appear at the top of the lists on list
pages and some browse results (e.g., :term:`subject` and :term:`place` browse
pages), and give the name of the :term:`field` for whatever is being isted
below. On some pages, the column headers include a |caret-down-grey| caret
icon next to the column header :term:`field` name - when pressed, these icons
will reverse the sort order of the data in the list based on that column
(i.e., changing from A-Z to Z-A, or from most recently updated first to
oldest update first).

Column headers appear wherever display data on a page has been organized into
a table, and are used extensively throughout the pages available in the
:ref:`Admin menu <main-menu-admin>`.

   The Identity and Context Areas in an ISAD(G) archival description

Information areas appear on :term:`view <view page>` and :term:`edit <edit
page>` pages of any standards-based description template in AtoM, and group
related :term:`fields <field>` based on the organization of elements of
description in `ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__ or other supported descriptive
standards. They are comprised of a number of :term:`fields <field>` in the
body of the information area, and an :term:`area header`, whose name is drawn
from the related area or section of the standard upon which the descriptive
template is based.

By default, when no data has been entered into a :term:`field` in an
information area's edit template, the field is not displayed when in
:term:`view mode`. Consequently, the size (length on a page) of an information
area will depend on the amount of data that has been entered (or imported) by
a user.

Clicking on the :term:`area header` of an information area toggles it between
closed (all fields in that area hidden) and open (all fields visible) when in
:term:`edit mode`; in :term:`view mode`, clicking on an :term:`area header`
will result in opening the related information area in :term:`edit mode`
(**if** the user is logged in and has sufficient :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>` to edit a record.)
