Navigation in AtoM
==================

This section introduces users to key navigation elements in AtoM, as well as
recurring page elements that can be used to perform a variety of functions
throughout the application. Navigating involves understanding the current
location (:ref:`entity <entity-types>` and page), what can be done from that
location (view, edit, add new, search, etc.), how to get related
:ref:`entities <entity-types>`, and how to go to other pages to do other
things unrelated to the current entity.

**Below you'll find an introduction to:**

.. _atom-header-bar:

The AtoM Header Bar
===================

The :term:`header bar` is the primary means to access, manage, and
create content in AtoM. It is persistent, meaning it remains available on all
pages throughout the application. The :term:`header bar` includes the log-in
button, :term:`language menu`, :term:`search box`, :term:`browse menu`, and
:term:`site logo` for all users, and the :term:`main menu` for authenticated
(i.e. logged in) users. Depending on a user's :term:`access privileges
<access privilege>`, the :term:`main menu` may show/hide different options -
for example, only :term:`administrators <administrator>` will see the
:term:`Admin menu`. Access privileges are based on defined :term:`user roles
<user role>` (see :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`).

.. _log-in-button:

Log-in button
=============

The log-in button, located in the :term:`header bar`, directs unauthenticated
(i.e. not logged in) users to a log in screen where users with a :term:`user
account` can enter their credentials (email and password) to log into the
application. Once a user has successfully logged in, the log-in button will
display their chosen user name. Clicking on the log-in button after logging in
will reveal a :term:`drop-down menu` with the option to log out, or to visit
the user's profile page, where a user can upate their credentials (username,
email, password).

* For more information on logging in, see: :ref:`Log in <log-in>`
* For information on user roles, see: :ref:`User roles <user-roles>`

.. _language-menu:

Language menu
=============

The :term:`language menu`, located in the :term:`header bar` in the top-right
corner of the page, allows the user to switch to any of the
:term:`supported languages <supported language>` in AtoM. It is available to
all users (whether or not they are logged in). It is represented by a globe
icon - clicking the globe icon will reveal a :term:`drop-down menu` that
lists the available languages. When a user selects a language from the menu,
the page will reload and all translated interface elements (such as menus,
edit templates, :term:`tooltips`, labels, help text, etc.) will appear in the
selected language, and will remain in the selected language until the user
changes the language again.

* For more information on changing the language, see: :ref:`Choose language
  <choose-language>`
