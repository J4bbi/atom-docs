Advanced search
===============

In addition to AtoM's general :term:`search box` (located in the AtoM
:term:`header bar`), AtoM also includes a robust advanced search interface
that allows user to build complex queries via the :term:`user interface`.
A number of filters have been included to narrow the search parameters, while
complex :term:`boolean search` queries using AND, OR, and NOT statements can
be built with the addition of search :term:`fields <field>`. The advanced search
interface is available to all users - i.e. you do not have to be logged in to
the application to access it. Note that it is designed to be used to search
for :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - please see the
sections on AtoM's :ref:`dedicated search boxes <dedicated-search>` and
:ref:`search-typeahead` for information on searching for different
:term:`entity` or record types.

This section will instruct you how to use AtoM's advanced search interface;
additionally, it will outline methods that are available in the general
:term:`search box` to perform advanced searches, using :term:`boolean search`
operators and special characters.

The Advanced search interface
=============================

This section will outline how to use AtoM's advanced search interface. The
advanced search interface is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text
matching a search query. The advanced search hyperlink can be accessed in the
:term:`drop-down menu` that appears when a user places the cursor in the
:term:`search box` located in the AtoM :term:`header bar`. In the advanced
search page, a user can select "and, or, not" operators, and search specific
:term:`archival description` fields, to create a powerful search query. The
option to apply filters to limit or narrow the search are also provided in a
friendly :term:`user interface`.

**To search for archival descriptions using the advanced search interface:**

1. Place your cursor in the :term:`search box` located in the AtoM
   :term:`header bar`. A :term:`drop-down menu` will appear below the search
   box - to access the advanced search interface, click on the "Advanced
   search" link in the drop-down menu.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The advanced search options described here apply **only** to searches for
   :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - the advanced search
   interface returns archival description results by default. To search for
   other :term:`entity` or record types, see the sections on
   :ref:`search-typeahead` and on the :ref:`dedicated-search` available in the
   :ref:`search-atom` section.

2. AtoM will redirect you to the advanced search screen:

3. To begin searching, enter a search term into the search field in the
central column of the page

         advanced search interface

4. Use the drop-down menu to limit your search query to a specific
   :term:`field` in the :term:`archival description` templates. The default
   setting is to search any field. Options include:

* Title
* Archival history
* Scope and content
* Extent and medium
* Subject access points
* Name access points
* Place access points
* Identifier

   :align: center

   :alt: An image of a user limiting a search term to the scope and content
         field using the advanced search interface

.. NOTE::

   The labels in the field :term:`drop-down menu` available in the advanced
   search interface are based on the labels used in the International Council
   on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) ISAD(G) standard. For more
   information on ISAD(G), see: :ref:`isad-template`. In other edit templates,
   label may appear differently - for example, "Archival history" is known as
   "Custodial history" in the :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` edit template, while
   "Extent and medium" is simply called "Extent" in the
   :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>`. However, search results for each field will be
   returned regardless of the template used for display.

5. Use the "Add new criteria" button to build multi-part queries with
   :term:`boolean search` operators via the :term:`user interface` - using
   these operators you can narrow your search, combine terms, or exclude
   terms. AtoM will add a new set of fields below, into which you can enter your
   terms - repeat steps 3-5 as necessary.

* Use AND to combine search terms to narrow your search: e.g. search
  *vancouver* AND *"city hall"* to return only descriptions that contain both
  search terms
* Use OR to to combine search terms to broaden your search: e.g. search
  *vancouver* OR *"city hall"* to return descriptions that contain either
  search term
* Use AND NOT to exclude terms: e.g. search *vancouver* NOT *"city hall"* to
  return descriptions that include vancouver but do not contain the phrase
  "*city hall*"
