Advanced search
===============

In addition to AtoM's general :term:`search box` (located in the AtoM
:term:`header bar`), AtoM also includes a robust Advanced search interface
that allows user to build complex queries via the :term:`user interface`.
A number of filters have been included to narrow the search parameters, while
complex :term:`boolean search` queries using AND, OR, and NOT statements can
be built with the addition of search :term:`fields <field>`. The Adanced search
interface is available to all users - i.e. you do not have to be logged in to
the application to access it.

This section will instruct you how to use AtoM's Advanced search interface;
additionally, it will outline methods that are available in the general
:term:`search box` to perform advanced searches, using :term:`boolean search`
operators and special characters.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The advanced search options described here apply only to searches for
   :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - the advanced search
   interface returns archival description results by default, and using the
   boolean operators for advanced searching in the search box requires a user
   to press enter, which by default returns archival description results in
   AtoM. To search for other :term:`entity` or record types, see the sections
   on :ref:`search-typeahead` and on the :ref:`dedicated-search` available in
   the :ref:`search-atom` section.
