Advanced search
===============

In addition to AtoM's general :term:`search box` (located in the AtoM
:term:`header bar`), AtoM also includes a robust advanced search interface
that allows user to build complex queries via the :term:`user interface`.
A number of filters have been included to narrow the search parameters, while
complex :term:`boolean search` queries using AND, OR, and NOT statements can
be built with the addition of search :term:`fields <field>`. The advanced search
interface is available to all users - i.e. you do not have to be logged in to
the application to access it. Note that it is designed to be used to search
for :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - please see the
sections on AtoM's :ref:`dedicated search boxes <dedicated-search>` and
:ref:`search-typeahead` for information on searching for different
:term:`entity` or record types.

This section will instruct you how to use AtoM's advanced search interface;
additionally, it will outline methods that are available in the general
:term:`search box` to perform advanced searches, using :term:`boolean search`
operators and special characters.

The Advanced search interface
=============================

This section will outline how to use AtoM's advanced search interface. The
advanced search interface is used to find descriptions in AtoM that contain text
matching a search query. The advanced search hyperlink can be accessed in the
:term:`drop-down menu` that appears when a user places the cursor in the
:term:`search box` located in the AtoM :term:`header bar`. In the advanced
search page, a user can select "and, or, not" operators, and search specific
:term:`archival description` fields, to create a powerful search query. The
option to apply filters to limit or narrow the search are also provided in a
friendly :term:`user interface`.

**To search for archival descriptions using the advanced search interface:**

1. Place your cursor in the :term:`search box` located in the AtoM
   :term:`header bar`. A :term:`drop-down menu` will appear below the search
   box - to access the advanced search interface, click on the "Advanced
   search" link in the drop-down menu.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The advanced search options described here apply **only** to searches for
   :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` - the advanced search
   interface returns archival description results by default. To search for
   other :term:`entity` or record types, see the sections on
   :ref:`search-typeahead` and on the :ref:`dedicated-search` available in the
   :ref:`search-atom` section.

2. AtoM will redirect you to the advanced search screen:

3. To begin searching, enter a search term into the search field in the central
   column of the page.

         advanced search interface

4. Use the drop-down menu to limit your search query to a specific
   :term:`field` in the :term:`archival description` templates. The default
   setting is to search any field. Options include:

   * Title
   * Archival history
   * Scope and content
   * Extent and medium
   * Subject access points
   * Name access points
   * Place access points
   * Identifier

         field using the advanced search interface

.. NOTE::

   The labels in the field :term:`drop-down menu` available in the advanced
   search interface are based on the labels used in the International Council
   on Archives (`ICA <http://www.ica.org/>`__) ISAD(G) standard. For more
   information on ISAD(G), see: :ref:`isad-template`. In other edit templates,
   labels may appear differently - for example, "Archival history" is known as
   "Custodial history" in the :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` edit template, while
   "Extent and medium" is simply called "Extent" in the
   :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>`. However, search results for each field will be
   returned regardless of the template used for display.

5. Use the "Add new criteria" button to build multi-part queries with
   :term:`Boolean search` operators via the :term:`user interface` - by using
   these operators, you can narrow your search, combine terms, or exclude
   terms. AtoM will add a new set of fields below, into which you can enter your
   terms - repeat steps 3-5 as necessary.

         button in the Advanced search interface

* Use **AND** to combine search terms to narrow your search: e.g. search
  *vancouver* AND *"city hall"* to return only descriptions that contain both
  search terms
* Use **OR** to to combine search terms to broaden your search: e.g. search
  *vancouver* OR *"city hall"* to return descriptions that contain either
  search term
* Use **AND NOT** to exclude terms: e.g. search *vancouver* NOT *"city hall"* to
  return descriptions that include vancouver but do not contain the phrase
  "*city hall*"

6. You can also add filters to your search to limit the results returned to
   specific parameters. The functions of each search filter are outlined
   below:

* **Repository**: Limit the search to the :term:`holdings` of a specific
  :term:`archival institution`. The :term:`drop-down menu` will be populated
  by all of the archival institution records in AtoM.
* **Top-level descriptions**: This is an auto-complete field that will
  populate with all of the top-level descriptions held in AtoM (generally,
  :term:`fonds` and :term:`collections <collection>`, but if a series or
  another level is set as the top level of a descriptive hierarchy, it will
  be available in the list). Begin typing the title of a top-level
  description, and the auto-complete will populate the :term:`drop-down menu`
  with matching selections. Click on one to select it - search results will
  be limited to :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` found
  within the chosen top-level description's descendants - i.e.
  :term:`children <child record>`.
* **General material designation**: This is a filter that is particular to a
  controlled field found within the :term:`RAD template <rad-template>` for
  archival descriptions - it is a controlled vocabulary drawn directly from
  the Canadian Rules for Archival Description, and managed in one of AtoM's
  :term:`taxnomies <taxonomy>` and used to define the type of material found
  within an :term:`archival unit`. Select a GMD term from the
  :term:`drop-down menu` to limit search results to descriptions that have
  been been marked with the matching GMD value.
* **Media type**: Used to search for a particular type of
  :term:`digital object`. Values include: Audio, Image, Other, Text, or
  Video. Selecting a Media type term from the :term:`drop-down menu` to limit
  search results to include only those descriptions with linked digital
  objects that match the selected media type.
* **Digital object available**: Use this filter to determine if a the search
  results returned include :term:`digital objects <digital object>` (e.g.
  images, audio or video files, text documents, etc.), or by selecting "No",
  include only results without digital objects.
* **Level of description**: This filter will limit the returned search
  results to a specific :term:`level of description`.
* **Copyright status**: AtoM :term:`archival description` templates include a
  "Rights" :term:`information area` that is drawn from elements of the
  `PREMIS <http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/>`__
  (Preservation Medata: Impmlementation Strategies) metadata standard
  maintained by the U.S. Library of Congress. Through this module, a user can
  add a copyright status to an archival description (with values including
  Public Domain, Under copyright, or Unknown). This filter will limit search
  results to those descriptions where a PREMIS Rights copyright status has
  been added matching the selection in the filter's :term:`drop-down menu`.

7. Click "Search" in the :term:`button block` to view the results of your search
   query. Results will appear in order of relevance below the button block. If
   there are more than 10 results, a pager will be included at the bottom of the
   results page.

8. Click on the blue titles to navigate to that result's specific page.
   Navigating back will bring you back to your original list of results;
   however, navigating to the "Advanced search" page from the :term:`search
   box` will require you to restart your search from the beginning

9. Your search can be modified at any time and the results refrehsed accordingly
   by simply changing the required search :term:`terms <term>` and :term:`fields
   <field>` and clicking "Search" once again. You can also restart your search
   at any time; simply click the "Reset" button in the :term:`button block`.

.. _advanced-search-operators:

Boolean operators
------------------

In AtoM, Boolean search operators are supported in the :term:`search box` and in
the Adanced search menu. Boolean searching is a particular application of what
is known as Boolean logic, a subset of algebra used for creating true/false
statements. Since computers operate in binary (using ones and zeroes), computer
logic can often be expressed in boolen terms (true/false). Boolean expressions
use a number of operators, the most common of which are AND, OR, and NOT - using
Boolean operators in terms of search queries (i.e. Boolean search) allows a user
to limit, widen, or otherwise define a search in granular terms  - for example,
searching "fonds OR collection" would widen a search to include results that
have either term in their title.
