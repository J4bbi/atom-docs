What is AtoM?
==============

**AtoM** stands for "Access to Memory". It is a web-based, open source 
application for standards-based archival description and accessin a 
multilingual, :term:`multi-repository <multi-repository system>` environment.


Technical overview
==================

**AtoM comprises:**

HTML pages served to a web browser from a web server. `Apache 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server>`_ is used in
development but AtoM is also compatible with `IIS 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services>`_.

A database on a database server. `MySQL 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL>`_ is used in development but AtoM uses a 
database abstraction layer and is therefore also compatible with Postgres, 
SQLite, SQLServer, Oracle, etc.

PHP software code that manages requests and responses between the web
clients, the application logic, and the application content stored in
the database.

The Symfony (`1.4 <http://symfony.com/legacy>`_) framework that organizes the 
component parts using object orientation and best practice web design 
patterns.

The Qubit Open Information Management Toolkit, developed by the AtoM
project and customized to make the AtoM application.


Web-based
=========

All user interactions with the system (add, view, search, edit, and
delete actions) take place through a web browser. Users access HTML
pages on the web server; clicking a button or link triggers a PHP script
that sends a command to the database and returns the output as HTML back
to the user's browser.

.. warning:: With the release of 2.0, AtoM will no longer support Internet 
  Explorer (IE) 8 or earlier versions. If possible, please upgrade your browser 
  to IE9 or higher, or use a supported browser such as `Firefox 
  <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop>`_, 
  `Chrome <https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/>`_, 
  `Opera <http://www.opera.com/browser/>`_, or `Safari
  <http://www.apple.com/safari/>`_.

  Please see :doc:`Technical requirements <technical-requirements>` for more 
  information. 
 
Open source
===========

AtoM is built with open source tools (Apache, MySQL, PHP, symfony)
rather than proprietary software. The underlying AtoM code is itself open 
source, with the source code freely available for use or modification as users 
or other :term:`developers <developer>` see fit (under the `A-GPL version 3 
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_ license). Therefore **there is 
no cost to download any of the software required to run the AtoM
application.**

* `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_

Standards-based
===============

AtoM is built around `International Council on Archives
<http://www.ica.org>`_ (ICA) descriptive standards:

* General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD) - 2nd
  edition, 1999
* International Standard Archival Authority Record (Corporate bodies,
  Persons, Families) (ISAAR) - 2nd edition, 2003
* International Standard For Describing Institutions with Archival
  Holdings (ISDIAH) - 1st edition, March 2008
* International Standard For Describing Functions (ISDF) - 1st edition,
  May 2007

AtoM supports Simple Knowledge Organization System (`SKOS 
<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/>`_) - W3C Recommendation 18 August 2009.

AtoM is designed to be flexible enough for adaptation to other
descriptive standards; see :doc:`Descriptive standards
<descriptive-standards>`.

list" accepting descriptions from any number of contributing institutions.
