Hardware and server environment
-------------------------------

Please note that it is difficult to provide an authoritative baseline or
recommended system specification for running AtoM because what is considered an
"acceptable" performance level is subjective, and the performance of the
application depends greatly on factors such as the how much data is in the
database, and how many users are accessing the site simultaneously.


Software dependencies (required)
--------------------------------

* A webserver like Apache or Nginx
* ElasticSearch 0.90.0 or newer
* MySQL 5.1 or newer

Other dependencies (not required)
