Windows

Every single piece of software
:ref:`required by AtoM <installation-requirements>` is compatible with Windows.
However, you should now that the process may not be straightforward at all if
you are not familiar with server environments under the Windows platform.


Virtualizing Linux
==================

We strongly believe that Linux is the best choice for you, but if for whatever
reason you can't switch to a different platform you may want to consider to
virtualize it1 Some of the most popular virtualization tools in Windows are:

* VirtualBox (open source): https://www.virtualbox.org/
* VMware: http://www.vmware.com/
* Hyper-V (the official Windows hypervisor):
  http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v-server

You should be able to use our virtual appliance in the virtualization tool of
your choice.

If you keep planning to use Windows, please continue reading this document. But
be ready for the hassle!


Web servers
===========

The good news is that the support of PHP in IIS7 or above is excellent. Check
out the official website: http://php.iis.net.

But you can also use Apache or Nginx, we tried it and it worked.

There's also the option of using `WampServer <http://www.wampserver.com/>`_ or
`XAMPP <http://www.apachefriends.org/>`_, two software stacks that provide you
with all the packages that you need in order to run AtoM out of the box, that's
it: MySQL, Apache and PHP. It's definitely a very good option for inexperienced
users.


Elasticsearch
=============

You can run Elasticsearch in Windows as long as you can install Java.
`Download <http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/`>_ the latest
version available and run :command:`bin/elasticsearch.bat`.
