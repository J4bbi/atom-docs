Mac OS X
========

OS X 10.7 (Lion) and newer ships with Apache and PHP. Recent versions of OS X
include PHP 5.4. On the other hand, MySQL can be installed using the
`official package <http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>`_.

However, we encourage you to use `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_, an open source
package manager for OS X that will make the installation of the dependencies
and its maintenance much easier. Installing homebrew is easy:

.. code-block:: bash

   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Note that Xcode is required, that you can download nowadays form the App Store.
More instructions can be found at:
https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Installation

Once it's installed, you ready to install all the packages needed:

.. code-block :: bash

   brew install php54 --with-mysql --with-fpm
   brew install nginx
   brew install elasticsearch
   brew install mysql55

Some extra dependencies can be installed via homebrew too:

.. code-block :: bash

   brew install ffmpeg
   brew install imagemagick
   ...
