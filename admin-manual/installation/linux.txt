Linux
=====

We use and recommend Ubuntu Linux as an easy to use Linux distro with a large
and lively community behind it - however, we've obtained satisfactory results
with a number of other distributions like Debian, CentOS or Fedora. Most of the
configuration steps described in this document apply to any modern Linux
environment, however some of them will apply only to Ubuntu and likely to any
Ubuntu-based distribution.

To be specific, this document is based in
`Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) <http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/>`_.
Once you have installed it, you should be able to follow the instructions
described below.


Install the dependencies
========================

The following components could be installed in a distributed manner.

MySQL
-----

We strongly recommend to use MySQL 5.5 as it's much better than its previous
major release in terms of speed, scalability and user-friendliness. Also, we've
experienced very good results using the forks Percona Server ands MariaDB, so
don't be afraid and use them if you want!

Let's install MySQL using :command:`apt-get`:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5 mysql-client-5.5

We're also installing :program:`mysql-client-5.5` as it is an important piece
of the software for the management of MySQL.

During the installation, you will be asked for the password of the defauld
administrator user (root).

Elasticsearch
-------------

A relatively new search server based on Apache Lucene and developed in Java that
has brought to us a lot of advanced features, performance and scalability. This
is probably the biggest change introduced in AtoM |version| and we are really
happy with the results. Things have change a lot since we used to interact with
Zend Search Lucene!

Ubuntu doesn't provide a package but you can download it directly from the
`Elasticsearch site <http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/>`_. It's always a
good idea to use the latest stable version available. The installation steps
are:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.5.deb
   sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-0.90.5.deb

Nginx
-----

We also like Apache and you should use it if you feel more confortable with it,
but we've found that Nginx adapts itself better to limited resource environments
while it also scales better and more predictable under high loads.

The installation in Ubuntu can't be easier:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install nginx

The team behind Nginx provides an official PPA channel for Ubuntu users that
support more recent stable packages. Ubuntu 12.04 is also supported in this
channel. This could be a good choice if you want to enjoy some of the latest
features and improvements added to Nginx while taking a minimal risk for your
production environments. If you are interested, run the following commands
instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx

PHP
---

Our favorite way to deploy AtoM is using PHP-FPM, a process manager that scales
better than other solutions like FastCGI. The following command will install it
along with the rest of PHP extensions required by AtoM to work properly.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install php5-fpm php5-curl php5-mysql php-apc

If you are stuck in Ubuntu 12.04 but you still want to try PHP 5.4 or PHP 5.5,
there is a PPA channel supported by Ondřej Surý. This is probably no the safest
way to go as his channel is not backed by the official Ubuntu team, but I can
tell that he is being very responsive pushing new releases as soon as they come
out from the PHP team. If you are still interested, please visit one of the
following links:

* PHP 5.4 channel: https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5-oldstable
* PHP 5.5 channel: https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/php5

Note that in PHP 5.5, php-apc was removed and its replacement for the user-space
caching capabilities is emulated by php5-apcu. Additionally, the JSON extension
is not included anymore as part of the PHP core, so you will have to install the
php5-json extension too.


Download AtoM
=============

The safest way to go is to install AtoM from the tarball, that you can find in
the `download section <http://www.accesstomemory.org/download/>`_. However,
experienced users may prefer to check out the code from our public repository.

The following instructions assume that we are installing AtoM under
:file:`/usr/share/nginx` and that you are using AtoM |release|.

Download the tarball
--------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   wget http://storage.accesstomemory.org/releases/atom-2.0.0.tar.gz
   sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/atom-2.0.0
   sudo tar czf atom-2.0.0.tar.gz --strip 1 -C /usr/share/nginx/atom-2.0.0
   sudo ln -sf /usr/share/nginx/atom-2.0.0 /usr/share/nginx/atom

Check out the code from git
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo mkdir /usr/share/nginx/atom
   sudo git clone git@git.artefactual.com:atom.git /usr/share/nginx/atom
   cd /usr/share/nginx/atom
   sudo git checkout tags/v2.0.0

If you are using git 1.8 or newer, you can alternatively checkout a specific tag
in one single line:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --branch v2.0.0 git@git.artefactual.com:atom.git /usr/share/nginx/atom

If you are not interested in downloading all the history from git, you could
also truncate it to a specific number of revisions, e.g.: just one revision

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --depth 1 git@git.artefactual.com:atom.git /usr/share/nginx/atom


Filesystem permissions
======================

By default, Nginx runs as the www-data user. There is a few directories under
AtoM that needs to be writable by the web server. The easiest is to update the
owner of the full directory and its contents by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chown -R -L www-data:www-data /usr/share/nginx/atom


Create the database
===================

Assuming that you are running MySQL in localhost, please run:

.. code-block:: bash

   mysql -h localhost -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE atom CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;"

If you didn't leave the root password blank (which is a good idea), you'll have
to add the --p switch to mysql, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   mysql -h localhost -u root -pYOURSECRETPASSWORD -e "CREATE DATABASE atom CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;"

If your MySQL server is not the same as your web server, replace "localhost"
with the address of your MySQL server.

.. warning::

   Plase make sure that you are using an empty database! Don't reuse an old
   database unless it's empty. You can always drop it by using the
   :command:`DROP DATABASE` command and then create it again.


Run the web installer
=====================

You should now be ready to run the installer. It's a simple web interface that
changes some internal configuration files according to your environment and add
the necessary tables and initial data to the database recently created.

Open your browser and type the URL in the address bar. The URL can greatly
change depending on your web server configuration. The URL will usually be
something like "http://localhost".
