Intended audience
=================

This manual is intended for systems administrators and developers seeking
information on the installation, configuration, maintenance, and development
of the AtoM application. Its focus is more technical in nature than the AtoM
:ref:`User manual <user-manual-home>` - if you are looking for information on
how to use AtoM via its web-based :term:`user interface`, please see the
:ref:`User manual <user-manual-home>`.

While we have tried to make this document usable by readers with a broad range
of technical knowledge, it may be too complex if you have no previous experience
with installing web applications or using the command line. If you'd like to
help us improve this documentation, please see our About/Contribute
documents.

If you are a non-technical reader and are just interested in trying out
AtoM, please check out the `AtoM online demo <http://demo.accesstomemory.org>`_
or our :ref:`installation-virtual-appliance`.
