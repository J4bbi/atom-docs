Virtual appliance
=================

Run AtoM as a virtual appliance on any operating system. This option allows you
to try AtoM on your personal computer - if you don't have access to your own
server - or on your virtualization infrastructure.

A virtual appliance is one file containing a minimal operating system and server
software. You can "play" this file with a free virtual machine player. When you
play the virtual appliance, it starts the second operating system and server
software inside the player, on top of your existing operating system. There is
no need to reboot or install anything except the player. You can then connect to
the web server running inside the virtual machine player with your regular web
browser.


Minimum hardware requirements
=============================

* Processor: Pentium IV or higher
* Memory (RAM): 256 MB of unallocated memory
* Hard drive space: a minimum of 1GB to test the system on a small scale


VirtualBox (OVF)
================

Our virtual appliance uses the industry-standard OVF (Open Virtualization
Format) format and it's designed for VirtualBox, although other virtualization
solutions may be able to import the file successfully. We hope to provide
appliances for other platforms in the future.
