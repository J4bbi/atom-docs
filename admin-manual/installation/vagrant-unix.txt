==========================
Using Vagrant (Mac, Linux)
==========================

This guide will setup a new Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine with AtoM
installed on your computer. This works on most operating systems, including
MacOX, Linux, FreeBSD and others. If you can install these and have at least
1024Mb RAM to spare you should be good.

.. warning::

   This virtual machine is not intended to be used in production. It targets
   developers or experienced users willing to try out AtoM using Vagrant. If you
   want to start using AtoM in produciton, please refer to the other methods of
   installations explained under this manual.


Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
------------------------------

#. Install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/ (or use your package
   manager).
#. Install Vagrant from http://www.vagrantup.com/ (or use your package manager).


Spin it up
----------

#. Create a new directory and open it.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir atom-vagrant && cd atom-vagrant

#. Download the configuration file (Vagrantfile).

   .. code-block:: bash

      wget http://storage.accesstomemory.org/Vagrantfile


#. Run Vagrant.

   .. code-block:: bash

      vagrant up

   Vagrant will download our custom box and boot it in VirtualBox.


Connect to AtoM
---------------

Now you should be able to connect to AtoM from your local browser.

#. Use http://10.10.10.10:8001 if you want to try AtoM 1.x.
#. Use http://10.10.10.10:8002 if you want to try AtoM 2.x.


Connect to the terminal
-----------------------

Run ``vagrant ssh`` from the same directory as where you ran ``vagrant up``.
Vagrant will connect you to the correct virtual machine.

.. code-block:: bash

   vagrant ssh

You'll find the source code of AtoM under the home directory.
